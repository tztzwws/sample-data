"Zaytoon is one of those great Mediterranean finds in Berkeley. With a fully stocked bar and lively atmosphere Zaytoon is perfect for a good formal dinner party with friends or an intimate quiet dinner with a loved one. 
Starting with the food we tried the following items:
Mazza platter : Amazing falafel (probably the best I've had) - although it is super small - great baba ganoush and hummus (nothing extra ordinary about these but definitely good), taboulleh was fresh and invigorating
Moussaka - Exactly as advertised - thin layer of cheese eggplant lasagna tasted great - Get it while it's hot
Chicken kabeb grill with rice/cous cous: Again the chicken was nice, tender and tasted perfect

We liked the falafels so much that we actually ordered a side of extra falafels and a side of hummus to go with it.

Moreover, they bring over complimentary fresh pita as per your needs. 

Coming to the drinks, I have to say they were decent but rather average given the decor of the place, the price of the drinks and size of their bar. 
We got the - 
 See you sousuh (forgettable)
 Second date (super strong, but good)
 Midnight (gin, cucumber and lemon juice which was great).

All in all I would definitely say this place is worth your time.",4,1,0,2,1
"Be prepared to wait for a table during peak lunch and dinner times. 

Is it worth the wait? Depends on the company you are with. If you are going to be chit chatting over a couple of drinks while you wait - sure! If you just want dinner...well then you can probably take it or leave it. 

This place is really cute and has a fun vibe. They have delicious cocktails although I am more of a horchata gal - which they make really well too.

The food is pretty good - lots of options - and the parrilla (grill) is fun. From the grill- I like the carnitas and jalape�����o sausage. I thought the chicken was dry. Their enchiladas are pretty good too. The dessert that I had (chocoflan) was meh. 

The service could be friendlier - although they might be too busy to really pay attention to that sort of detail and just want to get you out of there. 

I really think they are more of a 3.5 overall but I rounded up because I did have ",4,0,2,0,1
"My new favorite Indian restaurant! I loved all the dishes we ordered. The service was great. I didn't get our waiter's name but he did a great job and he was so friendly. He was young and had curly hair. He was great and made our experience at the restaurant even better.

We ordered the sev puri and chicken lollipops for our starters. My friend wasn't a fan of the puri but I enjoyed it. The chicken lollipop was tasty with the dip and fried corn batter. We ordered the chicken tikki masala and bhindi masala for our lunch combos. They offer the full menu as well but if you want a smaller portion, you definitely should order from the lunch menu. It was perfect portions. It also comes with rice, daal, and naan. You can get more naan and rice if it is not enough. The chicken tikki masala and bhindi masala were both delicious. Bhindi masala is an okra dish so order it if you like okra! The naan was yummy too. I also ordered chai which was good but nothing too special. 

I will definitely come here again for the food and service. I need to get that waiter's name next time! I usually don't get good service at a restaurant so when I do, I don't forget it!",5,3,6,5,1
"President Obama was here!

Really!

There are photos in the window which prove that President Obama ordered and picked up take out food from Great Eastern Restaurant! How cool is that?!?

I just wanted to have dimsum in San Francisco's Chinatown. Christine made it happen and then some! She invited a few people and I invited a few friends! Combined, we had an awesome time!

We were seated downstairs where the restrooms are located. Our servers were busy and quite efficient. We got a kick out of the reaction of the first guy whose eyes opened widely and with a major jaw drop, said that we ordered too much! Haha! We were starving!

Anyway, we had a fun feast and gorged ourselves on shrimp dumplings (ha gow), cha siu bao (BBQ pork buns), fried taro gok, cherng funn, spare ribs, mochi rice wrapped in Lotus leaves, XLB (xiao long bao), and more! Everyone got some leftovers to take home and enjoy again!

Thanks to Christine for setting up this foodie adventure!",4,33,42,41,1
"Very busy place! I showed up at 1:30PM for a late lunch. We had 13 parties in front of us! There is no need to fear though they have a quick turnover and we got seated very quickly! Service is very fast. There are 2 downsides 1) this is a cash only establishment and 2) they kept trying to speak to us in mandarin which unfortunately I don't know . Noodles are super fresh. The spicy garlic pork noodles are very garlicky and flavorful. The Spicy beef noodle soup isn't too spicy and the beef is very good, the soup is light and not to heavy. 
I will absolutely be back when I'm in the area.",4,0,2,1,1
"This is located in a non descriptive strip center with a Mi Ranchito Mexican market and Maude laundromat. Parking is a bit of a mess as all the stores in the area try to claim to park only to use their services. Since PL has very few spots I didn't listen to those warnings and didn't get any ticket so park at your own risk. 

Inside is like any normal pho joint. Pleasant but slightly tacky interior with the numbered tables, lots of plastic spoons and chopsticks in their holders, and the condiments of fish sauce rooster sauce salt and pepper. Lady first tried to take the orders put soon realized she doesn't understand English well enough so calls out to a guy who doesn't look Asian but more of Mexican heritage. Glass he took over because asking for where the vegan Ramen was met with a blank stare. 

Finally found the veggie ramen on the back of the menu kind of hidden with all the other menu items. Turns out they had two vegan options. One was a regular Pho and one was Bun Bo Hue but instead comes with tofu and veggies. Since I like spicy I got that one and looking over the menu I saw they make fresh thicker wider noodles you can sub out for $.75 which seemed worth doing since I'm picky when it comes to noodles and these looked good. All in
All the pho here is a bit pricey at like $13 compared to let's say east SJ but I'm
Ok with that if it's tasty. They also seem to nickel and dime you if you want more topping like sprouts but I was able to convince the waiter to give me a tray of basil and didn't charge me extra. The normal default for the soup is mint which just ok but not my favorite herb in the world.

By the way most of the people dining here are Asian which is a good sign in my book. Got my bowl of noodles with the condiments and was pretty impressed. Small plate not only had sprouts but shaved cabbage both purple and green and some jalape�����os and a half lime which actually wasn't hard as a rock like other pho joints. The soup had a nice layer of fatty spicy oil on top and the soup was quite a . Noodles were nirvana super soft and pillowy but also firm and didn't fall apart. Broth was on point and tasty for a veggie based broth. Loved the tofu here especially when bathed in the spicy oil on top. Veggies were fresh and plentiful with broccoli cabbage and onions 
And the mixed in sprouts and jalape�����os made it taste as Yelp says if my revi""pretty epic"";)

My only slight complaint but not worth removing a star was all the meat pho options give you two sizes small and large but with the veggie pho you can only get a large. Normally I get a small as it's enough for me since all those noodles and veggies are filling and I'm not one to take pho leftovers. Basically I left about 1/4 of my soup not eaten so a smaller size would be a nice option. Other than that it's hard to say anything negative about this place. It fits all the criteria on a solid bowl of noodles and I'm surprised I didn't find this place sooner. Gives me a new reason to come to Sunnyvale again. Over and out...",5,14,15,15,1
"Great crispy fresh fries, real flavorful strawberry shake. 

The garlic aioli is a miss, the nuggets are a miss, the lettuce tastes left out. The burger is the best in general i've had in the bay area, but it is in competition with little big burger and burgerville from Portland.",4,0,0,0,1
"Loved everything about my meal here, from sitting at the marble counter to the wonderfully curated wine list, balanced and thoughtful cocktails, and then of course the menu including two of my favs... tartare and oysters. The Cesar salad was also to die for. If you like any of the greats in SF, being the Progress, Rich Table, Che Fico, etc this place sits among them and you will have a killer meal. 

Wonderful food in a casual but beautiful space. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend/ go again. One word of caution, don't let the inner Richmond location fool you.. these are prime SF prices, I think it ended up being $300 for the two of us after tip.",5,0,2,0,1
"Come to this restaurant if you want to experience a real umma's (Korean mom's) cooking. It's a one-woman show and she locks the door when she can't handle any more customers. If you run into this situation, you can wait outside and she'll start letting people in again when she's ready. I gotta respect that attitude. 

We ordered a seafood bibimbap $16.95, a beef bibimbap $14.95, and a seafood tofu soup $11.95. The bibimbaps were delicious, but I probably wouldn't order the tofu soup again. You couldn't see any pieces of seafood in it, and there wasn't very much quantity. Maybe I'd get a kimchi stew instead?

A bottle of beer is $6 and is enormous about equal to two normal bottles of beer. This is the best value on the menu. 

Going with the theme, this is a homestyle place, so you get some typical homestyle banchan. If you want excitement and ambiance, go somewhere else. If you want comfort Korean, come to Um Ma Son.",4,0,2,0,1
"Oh Golden Boy. If you go at a busy time you will find a long line outside, but during non peak times I have walked in and gotten to order right away. The pizza reminds me of the same style you get in Italy which is great. It tastes like the pizza is cooked on top of focaccia bread. The clam pizza they are known for is delicious and is not overpowering with clam flavor but unique and garlicky. Other classic flavors are also good. I would suggest going at a non-peak time and don't forget this place is cash only!",5,0,0,0,1
"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend for date night and was very pleased with our overall experience! We both had a drink - white sangria and the passion fruit basil mojito & both were awesome! I love tapas so this spot is really great if you're into that. They also have some really good entrees instead of going the tapas route. We had the plantain chips with guacamole for an appetizer and it was super good, definitely a pretty filling portion! We also ordered the mango spinach salad which was so good and also super sizable, good portion sizes. The paella was awesome. It came with shrimp, clams, mussels, chicken, chorizo and veggies. At first I was unsure about the smokiness it had, but it was very subtle and added a really nice twist on paella. Overall loved this place! Will come back.",5,1,1,1,1
"Yelpers, say it with me, ""It's all about the Porchetta!"" 

GOOD LAWDD! 

Yesss, Yelpers! The porchetta was finger-licking good! OMG. How did I luck up and find this hidden gem?!

Papaito Rotisserie is the spot that all my Yelp friends need to discover and check out! I dined here last night, and it was delicious! My roommate and I walked in and were greeted right away by the lovely Joseph. I love the philosophy of this restaurant: two restaurants in one setting. Inside of the same establishment there is Antigua that serves breakfast and lunch and Papaito Rotisserie serves dinner; fantastic idea! I was really surprised to see the amazing choices of all the vegetarian choices at this place. Everything you could think of was on the menu to order, brussels sprouts, corn, kale salad and carrots. 

How it works? You order your main dish, choose a side, and then pick a type of sauce (che-micharri, French, chipotle or salsa picante--add a $1 for the sauce. TIP: You get an opportunity to try out the different sauces at the counter. 

The inside of the restaurant is spacious with tons of seating! I love that they have a self-serve for the water, brilliant idea! 

After looking at the menu, I was sold on the Porchetta with the Brussel sprouts and the roasted seasoned potatoes and my friend went for the herb chicken. The dishes are offered in small or large--honestly, I didn't see a big difference in the size. ::shrugs::

Once the food arrived at the table, I was pleasantly surprised as all the food looked good! My porchetta was the star of the night; that meat was so damn delicious with the crispy pork skin, and the tender meat made my taste buds jump for joy. I truly recommend ordering this! The sides were a good balance to the meal. 

The service here was phenomenal! Big shout out to Joseph who walked me and my friend through the whole ordering process. Would I recommend Papaito Rotisserie? Hell, yea! Without a doubt! 

Ey, Papa!",5,26,40,38,1
I fell in love with Shihlin's XXL crispy fried chicken at their Stonestown location and the chicken is just as good and yummy here. You can control the spice level but I just get mild since I can't spicy. The chicken is so moist and juicy inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside. You have to eat this fresh. I typically go with a caffeine free winter melon tea to balance it out. Soooo good! There is a little bit of a wait for the chicken since they make it to order but it is soooo worth it!

"I've been here once before, but it'd been a few years before I made a return trip this past Friday. I must say, I'm a fan. After being disappointed by other KBBQ in the area, I decided to go w/the devil I knew instead of the devil I didn't and came back. This place is pretty small inside, so get here early to grab a seat (not sure if there's reservations). We went with the following:

-Bibimbap (pretty good, the rice isn't that crispy but there's good flavor)
-Kimchi ramen soup w/Beef (""spicy"" level, actually pretty spicy so eat this slowly or fast, depending on your spice tolerance)
-short ribs (really good, a lot of meat on the bone, and not over or undercooked, always my go-to)
-Pork belly skewers (too bad it only comes in a set of 2, because this is really good too--tender as hell pork)

The service is pretty efficient, even though it's only two servers. 

Also can catch a game here with the overhead TVs. I do like this place, so will be back if in the Newark area, as it's confirmed good Korean food. Just hopefully you don't have to wait too long for a seat.",4,0,0,0,1
"Expect at least a 1 hr wait-- there is a line inside in addition to the line outside! The bottleneck is them putting together the udon in front of you because there are usually empty seats and no wait for payment. 

Love the fast casual model and their sneakily expensive tempura that I always get too much of. The udon here isn't as QQ as the one in stonestown and noodles were way too cut up--we need long noodles for long life!!!!

 Besides that, still a pleasant experience and convenient location. Looking forward to more hours!",4,3,5,2,1
"A nice Thai restaurant right near the corner of Mason and Bay. I ordered the panang vegetarian dish which was served very promptly and was quite tasty. The menu is fairly traditional Thai.

The decorations were very nice, it reminded me of an ocean harbor. It was very clean and tidy. Their customer Service was also great. I heard their chowder fries is also a popular item so I'm going to try that next!

Place is also well maintained and clean and more importantly the food is so well prepared and is 5 stars alone!

That being said, make sure you book a table on the weekends or you will have a good wait here. We tried their paella, grilled octopus, brava patata, meatballs, Brussels sprouts, crab Croquetta and beef skewers. All the dishes we ordered were delicious and we had to keep ordering because they were gone in seconds with a big group! 

Almost forgot but their sangria is amazing and so are other cocktails! I even tried their virgin Sangria once and it is so delicious! This is such a great place for dates, birthdays, and just a fun night out!",5,1,1,2,1
Ordered stirred pork with white pepper. It was really tasty. Was a little spicy but good for my liking. This is a new restaurant and I just happened to see this while going to another restaurant.

My go to is the veggie burger with a sunny side up egg, runny. The veggie burger is FULL of flavor and definitely not your ordinary veggie burger. 

Talk about gourmet burgers. 

Their truffle fries are also delicious and big enough to share between 2 people, I could also say the same about the burgers. Portions are huge, I've yet to finish a burger myself, always leaving 1/4 left. So if you're not super hungry, you might want to share with someone :-)",5,0,2,0,1

"What a hidden gem! 

We made our way over here after hearing about it from a colleague. It was difficult to find parking, but we ended up parking in the California parking garage off of Jackson. It was $2 every 30 minutes with a max of $12. 

It was a short little walk from there to the restaurant. We went in and it wasn't very busy, but it was super clean and organized looking. Which can be somewhat hit or miss in Chinatown so I appreciated that. We were told to sit wherever we would like and we were promptly brought menus and water. They brought a big pitcher of water so we could have it throughout the meal. 

We ended up ordering potstickers, sizzling beef short ribs, kung pao chicken, and chicken fried rice with no egg. We also got a pot of jasmine tea to enjoy. 

The food came quick and smelled delicious! We loved every dish. The potstickers definitely needed to be eaten with the sauce that they brought them with, otherwise they were a bit bland. The beef short ribs were super flavorful! I loved all of the veggies it came with. It was kind of like an Asian version of fajitas. The Kung Pao chicken wasn't overly spicy and had a good ratio of chicken to veggies to peanuts. Finally, the fried rice was pretty awesome! You could tell that they made everything fresh, and we really appreciated that it didn't taste overly salty or like MSG. They were very friendly, fast, and made delicious food. I would come back! 

I'd say sadly this place gets overlooked- but it is delicious! Go here if you want somewhere decently priced to share a meal with your family or date, but don't want to wait in a huge line or eat somewhere questionable. Give Begoni a chance!",5,0,1,0,1

"I love spicy food. I hate Szechuan numbing spice. I love Chinese food! This place met all my criteria which can only lead to great things for my taste buds. 

Food: 
That pork belly cucumber dish is one of the tastiest dishes I've ever had. Actually, all the dishes were very flavor packed. If you are looking for a bland healthy meal....please move along. The pork belly cucumber dish and the fried black sesame ball dish is a must order. 

Service: 
Very friendly staff. Place gets pretty packed, but the staff is able to keep up with the pace. 

Environment: 
Very modern design. Parking is okay here. I suggest getting here when they open to ensure you get a seat. Otherwise you'll be hanging outside for about an hour or so.

The place has a nice atmosphere; perfect to take dates or your wifey. I've only had the Bone-in Ribeye at this place but I've been here on multiple occasions and still love this dish to this day. My wife orders the lamb chops which is enough for her to take home for a second meal. Both dishes are great and would definitely recommended checking this place out.

Came here for an early dinner before seeing Hamilton about 30 seconds down the road. We came at 445 and glad we did as there were a lot of reservations and reserved tables already. I was a bit worried as we sat there for about 10 min before anyone came over but once our server did we were rolling. We ordered the fried chicken dinner with clam chowder. The dinner came with mashed potatoes and a corn salad. The chicken was good and crispy my husband liked it more than I did. The mashed potatoes were decent and the corn salad was ok. One of the kids got the bacon mac and cheese which was super cheesy and creamy but so rich between the four of us we didnt finish it. The other kid got the Cobb salad which she said she would pay $40 for. We also did an order of the tator tots with spicy kimchee which was pretty good. My favorite of the night was the clam chowder. It was a bit on the thin side and didnt have huge pieces of clam but it was full of flavor. This place is really the closest thing to theater and is open late so I see the popularity of it.

"This little hole in the wall has parking along the street or in the back lot for the strip center. Seating inside and out, but only 9 tables total. They have a restroom, but you must enter through the back of the building. Try slipping through the laundromat next door as a short cut.

Inside is counter service, with the fresh juices behind the counter, a cooler of sodas, and assorted Jamaican bottled drinks like Ting. I went with the mango passion fruit juice. It's mostly mango and you can hardly taste passion fruit, but it's still pretty good!

For my entree, I picked the oxtail and jerk chicken combo, which comes with plantains and rice and beans. This dish really hit the spot. The rice and beans seems to be made with coconut milk and unlike any other rice and beans I've had at other Caribbean places. They gave me 2 pieces of dark meat chicken and 3 thin oxtail pieces. Both meats were excellent, neither were spicy...but the oxtail was slightly better. I was hoping the jerk chicken sauce would be spicy, but it wasn't ....at least not the batch I was given. 

Overall, it really hit the spot and was priced appropriately. I'd come back if I was ever in the area again.",5,1,1,1,1
"Y'all this is my spot! Well it really was a years ago when I liked just about 15 minutes away. I used to come here at least once every 2 weeks with my mom or friends. 

Since I don't live in the area, I don't come here as often but because of nostalgia and a recent visit, I still just love this place and have to give it 5 stars. Definitely my favorite Filipino spot in the South Bay/ever tbh. 

Get the Specialty Combo. It's $10.95 and you get to choose from a variety of meat options like BBQ and lechon. That's a steal!!! It also comes with Java Rice, achara and special sauces. Their Java Rice is... I don't even know. I know I've asked before and it's pretty much just their specialty rice, it's really good. Definitely get it even if it's extra! Achara is their pickled carrots/veggie slaw, soooo good. The specialty combo is more than enough for one person. Can maybe even share it with an appetizer and you'd be full. 

I like my Specialty Combo with: 
- BBQ on a stick (sometimes they run out but not too often) 
- Crispy Chicken
- Lechon Kawali 
- Inihaw ne liempo 

Another one of my favorites here is the Crispy Pata and Chicharon Bulaklak. Although I'm not sure the Bulaklak is still on the menu... which makes sense because I mostly am the only person I know who likes Chicharon Bulaklak haha. (if you don't know what it is, look it up and you'll understand) 

Aside from the amazing food. I like that it's in a random neighborhood. There's always parking in the lot across the street. Except avoid coming here on Saturdays for lunch because of the farmer's market that would be wrapping up on this street. 

The restaurant itself could be cleaner. Not that it's particularly dirty but it just looks like it could use a little freshening up if that makes sense. The service is also great. I believe the owner is the guy with the mustache - he used to always take my orders but I also see him whipping up the food too. Everyone has always been so nice and friendly to me. 

On my most recent visit I felt really bad because I heard of lot of complaints about people not being full from their food and all these other things. Being Filipina myself, I don't think I could ever serve a room full of hungry Filipinos, but the workers here do a great job and always do their best! 

Will be coming here as often as I can until I die or they close! Hopefully neither of these happen so I can keep munchin' on that java rice. Definitely give this place a shot if you're looking to try or already like Filipino cuisine and want some stuff your aunties/uncles would actually cook up for you!",5,0,0,0,1
"Sliced bean curd with mixed vegetables - Surprisingly the most flavorful dish. Bean curd was juicy. The mushroom was thick, chewy, and wet.

Stir fried vegetables - Slightly oil, light on the stomach, and plain. Just how I like it. 

Fried tofu soup with vegetables - Has chicken in it. Broth was warm and comforting.

Interior - Very simple with almost no work done on decor. Nostalgic of the restaurants in Asia.",4,5,4,5,1
"I came here on a recommendation from a Turkish friend, whose parents and grandparents absolutely love the place. I've never had Turkish food before, but now I'm a fan! 

The atmosphere was classy but warm and welcoming. I ordered the Adana Kebab ($16.95), which was kind of like a lamb/beef sausage with pita, rice, bulgur and vegetables on the side. This is a bit pricier than I'm used to, but the portion was large enough and the taste was great, so it was definitely worth it! My friend also ordered a Cigar Borek, which is similar to an eggroll filled with cheese; it was also delicious. The free bread that they gave us to start off the meal, which came with a delicious buttery orange sauce, was excellent as well. 

Overall, the service was polite and friendly and the food was great! Parking was also easy because the place is located in a large shopping center. There's also a bar for anyone interested in that! I'd definitely come back.",5,1,2,0,1
"Came on a Friday night 20 minutes before they opened without a reservation and we (2 people) were 3rd in line and were seated without a reservation! However, they did notify us that we had to be done by 7:15pm. 

Here's what we ordered:

Grilled salmon and salmon roe clay pot: when they brought this to the table, they asked if we wanted it mixed, and we said yes. The way they mixed it was a show and it looked so perfect and delicious. And it was just as delicious as it looked!

Sashimi salad: greens and assorted sashimi. The dressing was very good and the sashimi pretty fresh

Monkfish liver: usually monkfish liver has this really intense fishy taste but it wasn't as strong but felt clean with a good flavor. Loved it!

Fried oysters: came out super hot and fresh. Definitely recommend

Grilled beef tongue: also delicious. It was tender but I'd recommend eating it right away when it's hot

The restaurant is fairly small so I would recommend making a reservation in advance. When you walk in your immediately greeted with a super small bar and a few bench + high chair/high top tables. As it hits prime time, expect this area to get crowded. Personally, I wouldn't want to be eating in this area bc of the waiting crowd and potential bumps.

Menu changes so be sure to check it online if you're a picky eater. Service staff were wonderful, nice, and check on you regularly. Ordered items came out quickly, but not rushed, allowing you time to finish and enjoy a plate before immediately digging into the next.

We went here for the BFs birthday celebration. Started with the tartare and deviled eggs. Tartare was delisciously served on a crispy toast with fresh tasting, perfectly seasoned meat. The deviled eggs looked beautiful, but the yolk part was a little too salty for my taste (especially paired with the crumbled bacon topper). The artichoke soup comes served warm with little hints of truffle. Our favorite starter was the Gouda souffl����� served with a fog jam. It was perfectly cooked! Ended dinner with duck breast over farro. Duck came out perfectly cooked. The farro is mixed with the jus and some of the duck meat; I could have eaten this just as is.

Overall, this was a nice restaurant. To be honest, I actually prefer this one over their sister restaurant,",4,1,1,1,1

If you live near El Cerrito, you may come. 
We came again because he loves Volcano roll. The restaurant was very busy. We ordered Sapporo black beer, some nigiri, tempura combo and oshinko maki and volcano roll. The price is very reasonable. We got ten stamps so signature roll is free next time! I recommend this place.",4,0,1,0,1

"It was dinner time and we decided to try a new place in our new neighborhood and found this place on Yelp. I was a bit nervous as some latest reviews did not have a lot of good things to say. The restaurant was small, not a place for a large group and it had a bad ventilation, so be prepared to smell like food when you leave lol.

I inquired about their cuisine and they confirmed the new ownership, the current Tibetan family took over about 6 months ago. Thus, they are introducing some Tibetan food such as Momo (basically steamed dumplings). I was not feeling for dumplings, so I opted to est their Tibetan special (menu listed on the chalkboard on the wall above the register area) called Dropa Khatsa. The waitress told me it was spicy and I told her, I could handle heat and she must have told the chef/cook that I was up for the challenge because WHAM!!! It just hit me every bite, I liked it!!! Made me feels like home! This dish was certainly not for the fainted hearts it was basically beef tripes cooked in spicy curry sauce, served with rice for just $9! Such a deal! It involved a lot of chewing, but hey, just a small price to pay for being adventurous. The next time I order this though, I would have to pair it with a different dish to switch up the flavor and reduce the chewing ahahahah.

Hubby ordered their vietnamese menu, the vermicelli bowl with egg roll and beef. I had a bite and it was good too! I liked that the fish sauce was not too fishy. 

With a glass of thai ice tea, our total bill came out to a bit less than $24 (include tax before tip). Certainly a reasonable meal and the portion was generous. 

Most people ordered takeout, and I certainly hope that this little hole in the wall thrive. I'll be back to try more of their food in the future. What a great little find!",4,2,3,3,1
"Think Vietnamese and Mexican fusion with refreshing, fruity drinks. We stopped by for happy hour on a Friday (HH ends at 6pm) to try out their HH food and drink offerings. FYI their happy hour is only in the bar area. They offer discounted drinks and selected food items are all $7. 

We got 4 items that was totally satisfactory as our dinner for 2 people: 
1. Fish tacos with avocado: loved how crispy the fish was and the avocado was a great touch! 
2. Wings: just ok. Not a lot of meat on the bones, but the sauce was good. 
3. Papaya salad: probably my favorite food item! Was super refreshing, had just the right amount of spice, and I loved the chips it came with for crunch. 
4. Pulled pork with tortilla chips: really great flavor and a generous amount of meat. 

I also got the pear drop, which was refreshing and tasty. Not too sweet, which was a plus. 

We were greeted right away when we walked in and seated at the bar right away, but I did find it quite odd that it took about 10 minutes for either of the 3 guys behind the bar to make eye contact with us (and we were definitely trying to make that connection). 

There's outdoor seating and we were able to find free parking right out front on Solano.",4,19,41,34,1

"Love the idea of affordable, exceptionally tasty pre-fixe. 

Only downside was the long wait and the less than awesome service. Our food went to the table next to us (they arrived 30 min after us) and we heard no apology or acknowledgement until we brought it up much later. Then, after saying we were ready to go home, they offered champagne as an apology. Ordinarily, this would be okay, but giving more food/drink to people who say they are ready to leave is not ideal. Would have been nice if they comp'd some of the drinks (we had already ordered) instead. 

I will say the ambiance was cute, and I'd be willing to go again because the food was quite good, but come on guys...have accountability for your mistakes! Communication is key. We'll understand :)",4,0,11,4,1

At first I was hesitant about this place. But when I walked in, there was a table of 10 Korean ladies there, so that made me feel much better. If real Koreans eat here, it's probably legit.

"This is a nice little Japanese restaurant to go to if you're in the area. Also peanut-free! It is a bit pricy, but I think what I got was filling. 

I got the Chicken Katsu, which came with a side of rice, edamame mix, and miso soup. That all came up to about $20. It was well portioned, and the chicken katsu was a bit eggy. I didn't mind that, since I like egg, but something to keep in mind if you're ordering.

Atmosphere is nice, but super loud as it is an enclosed space. Ordering is done through an iPad, and food comes out fast. You pay at the front as you leave, which was kinda confusing at first.

Overall, I would try this place again. It's good for groups, and could be nice for casual dates, as it is a loud environment.",4,1,1,1,1
"What a lovely dinner with friends. We opened the meal with the blue cheese salad ($9), honey bbq shrimp ($14), and the crab cakes ($15). We then shared the specialty for the evening: Fresh trout stuff with crab and shrimp ($28). It was topped with a mango salsa and came with a side of roasted red potatoes and seasonal vegetables (onions, zucchini, squash, carrots, & broccoli). 

The fish was grilled whole with the stuffing which made for a nice smokey flavor. The fish was cooked perfectly with minimal bones considering the fish came whole with head and tail still attached. The dish also came with a sauce of crunchy remoulade sauce but you didn't need it. 

It was perfectly portioned for one person so I suggest in the future to get two or three orders of the fish for a group.

"Pretty decent fast casual Italian nosh in Hayes Valley. Upon returning from 2 weeks in Italy, I wanted to keep the spirit alive (as well as my taste buds) and continue on at least a few more days with indulging in the glory of Italian cuisine.

After a strategic search I came across the intriguing menu from Italian Homemade Company in Hayes Valley. Hadn't realized it was a local chain at the time - so I'm even more impressed by the menu's authenticity and the options available that are - in the scheme of things - relatively affordable based on San Francisco standards.

I had the Piadina Grassona - a flat bread sandwich with homemade Italian sausage, bell pepper and onions. Its was all savory goodness and just the right size. There were several other Piadina options mostly meats but a few vegetarian (not vegan) selections. Piadina was $12.50.

I also ordered the oven baked tomato salad. Which wasn't exactly what I expected but was decent anyway. Its essentially a green salad with a baked tomato set on top of it. Decent but didn't knock my socks off.

From the outside, it didn't look like much. The inside of the restaurant is small, but has a nice atmosphere and enough seating for a good amount of people. The decor was cute and we enjoyed the view of the wide variety of wines behind the bar.

We got there pretty last minute before close. Even though I am sure the waitress and kitchen staff weren't appreciative of this, the service was lovely and we never felt uncomfortable. The waitress politely reminded us the kitchen would be closing soon in the kindest way possible.

We all ordered various pasta dishes, each with no complaints! I especially loved my pesto pasta, it was superb.

I later dropped my chopsticks and thought the server who passed by saw it and ignored it but he actually grabbed a spare for me as we were asking. 

Later, I tried cutting up the Harami and this other server told me the flavor is locked in by grilling the entire steak and then cutting it up. She then replaced the shears we had used to cut the raw meat. How attentive! 

As Choi had recommended, we loved our Asahi. He was hilarious throughout the entire process and I can honestly say he's one of the nicest people I've met. 

And the food? Phenomenal!! What great quality! The only thing was the salmon took much longer to cook than expected but just keep checking up on it from time to time.

"The first time I tried boiling point, I didn't really like it because my pot had too many veggies. This time, I decided to get the korean bean paste one because it had rice cake. The broth was really good and not spicy since I got mild, but it was a bit salty. The noodles were very good and so was the pork belly, but I wish there was more pork belly. The other thing I liked was how they had bean sprouts with mine and kimchi, whick added a nice boost of vegetable to the pot. 

I wasn't really into the rice, though. It was a bit bland, but that's probably because you're supposed to eat it with the rest of the broth. 

The complimentary drink at the end was really nice. It reminded me of lemonade with really sweet basil seeds.

"Quick Summary:
- Small but lively place (table turnout is quick)
- Ordering is done at the table in the middle of the restaurant (do that before you find a seat)
- Al dente pasta

This has been in my recommended places to go and have pasta, so I would like to share my review here. It's one of my favorite places to have a delicious and hearty plate of pasta that will leave you very full. 

The staff is quick, takes orders and serves in a swift pace. When you dish is ready, they will call out your name and once you acknowledge, they will deliver the dish to you, so keep your ears out for your name. 

I have tried a few dishes, and I love how the pasta is al dente. It has a strong chewy texture. I like chewy noodles and pasta, and the texture is perfect. For this round, I ordered the butter and sage sauce with the ravioli.
On a different note, their pasta and sauce ordering style is unique, in that you can mix and match what to pick. However, I don't know what is the ideal and best match, so for both occasions, I asked the staff their recommendations. Since I wanted to eat a dish with butter and sage, they recommended me either the ravioli dishes or the gnocci. I opted for the ravioli because I wanted something with meat. I would recommend this dish as well. The meat inside the ravioli is creamy and dissolves quickly without chewing.",5,0,0,0,1
"Difficult to find parking especially on a Friday night. We parked in the SP+ parking lot which was about. 15 minute walk away. There's some street parking on the side of the restaurant but looks a bit sketch at night.

I believe my boyfriend and I just happened to be one reservation away from sitting at the bar since we were served food first before any other tables but after everyone at the bar has been served. Make sure you allocate for about 3 hours because that's how long the duration of the meal was. 

Anyways on to the food. $90 pp for the omakase but they also have supplemental additives. We got the exclusive supplemental which is an additional $65pp with 7 pieces. 
I recommend getting the supplemental items, they're definitely worth it. The two chef choice picks were miso butter snow crab and scallop with caviar. Along with Hokkaido Uni and Choro with Uni on top, Miyazaki Wagyu with shaved Ankimo, Anago (eel) , tamago. All pieces were really good. I'd definitely recommend coming here.

They do have a yelp check in, which you can use to get 5% or 15% (??? i would double check that) off discount on their crazies/cravies(?) fries.

"Excited that there's a good Korean restaurant in the area! I've been to My No. 1 BBQ and Tofu quite a few times, but just haven't had the time to write a proper review. So here goes:

- Food
+ Fried chicken -- this is one of the best dishes available here. If you take a look around, most tables will have ordered the fried chicken, and with good reason! I typically order a half order of the sweet & spicy and a half order of the soy garlic.
+ Bibimbap -- Super fresh and tasty. Good portions of meat (I've tried the bulgogi). You can also get it in a stone hot pot (i.e., dolsot bibimbap).
+ Ttuk Bulgogi -- Beef noodle soup with a really big portion of meat! 
+ Seafood pancake -- Kind of doughy compared to what I'm used to. I've had it once or twice, but I wouldn't say it's on my ""must order"" list.

- Service
+ Kind and attentive. When they start getting packed, it does get a little slower, but I know that they're doing their best to make sure everyone is taken care of.

"Try as I may to tie this review into the ""Russian meddling"" scandal or the million other stories of Russia/Trump relations I consume daily, I cannot. There's nothing about any of that which brings me joy or happiness while pretty much every Russian thing I consumed at Red Tavern did just that. 

Our party of 6 dined here in the sleepy Outer Richmond, sating ourselves with too much food and ample good cheer. This restaurant, with dishes that harken back to a time pre-dating the small-plate craze, is proof that San Francisco is not 100% overpriced food from which you leave hungry. Perhaps we over-ordered (we did), but I took home leftovers equivalent to an additional two meals. This is hearty fare. 

In a perfect world, every meal would begin with a Blini Tower. For $38.50 (serves 2 - 3), this tower comes with crepes, sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon (wrapped around thinly sliced-lemon), and another wonderful fish. We shared two towers between 6 people and it was adequate though I'll admit I'd probably be happy with a single platter to myself. Pure deliciousness. 

A Russian amongst us explained that we must get ""Olivie"" ($8.75), an authentic concoction akin to both potato salad and egg salad. Filling and satisfying, I liked that too.

Dumplings (Pelmeny) excited me less than Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsy) which were ample in portion and quite good. Short Rib Beef Stew excited me more than the pastry puff-topped Beef Stroganoff (very good as a leftover) though that enticed me a bit more than the Chicken Shashlik which tasted like a grilled chicken I might make at home. Even ranking the food in order of like to like-less however, I come away with a single conclusion: I basically liked it all.

With a most reasonable $12 corkage fee and hearty entrees running $17 - $22 Red Tavern feels like a bit of a throwback. The interior is nicer than that of any restaurants in the surrounding blocks (not a high bar to scale) and is comfortable, not fancy. 

With one exception, I found Red Tavern to be a perfect place for a group gathering as well as a fantastic spot to sate my hunger: The obvious accompaniment to that Blini Tower is a shot or two of Russian Vodka, not sold here at Red Tavern. Just as Trump is overlooking the recommendation of additional Russian sanctions, I was able to overlook the missing accompaniment. And just like that, it didn't make me happy, but life continued. 

Red Tavern is quite good.",4,5,9,8,1

"Took the bf here after Sharks Fan Fest since this was another one of my favorite South Bay restaurants. At this point I do wonder if the bf is overly critical of restaurants outside SF or maybe I just have rose-colored glasses or hype them too much bc he has yet to be impressed by any of the places I've dragged him to (which my other friends, including SF friends, have liked). 

I thought this would be a winner but he didn't like the ramen as much as I thought he would. He thought the broth had some sort of bitter undertone to it which he didn't like although he couldn't quite figure out what it was. It made him not finish the broth which he usu does when he has ramen. He suspected it might have been something burnt like burnt garlic, which he is more sensitive than I am. (My parents have been burning garlic my entire life! Haha.) I liked my ramen as much as I always do here. 

I also suggested we get the chicken karaage bc I was pretty sure it was good here although it had prolly been a couple years since I last had it. Luckily I was right. It was so plump and juicy and well-seasoned. The bf said that only thing that kept it from being perfect is not being crispy enough which is prolly true, but otherwise stellar. 

The takoyaki however just felt like too much batter with a piece of octopus thrown in. I think it would have been better off if the octopus was chopped up into smaller pieces and better dispersed throughout the ball bc otherwise the balance was just too off. 

No matter what the bf thinks though, this is still one of my favorite ramen joints in the South Bay haha. I love that I could join the Yelp waitlist ahead of time now too, bc I remember some long waits back in the day after writing my name on the clipboard once I arrived.",4,0,0,0,1
"This place is pretty neat. The vibe is relaxed and kind of something you'd find off the side of a highway on a road trip, it's got character. I got a hotdog with chili to go. It seemed there was one or two people working but got it rather fast. They hand it to me in a to go container and it feels really hefty, something I'm not expecting. I get to my place and open it up and the hotdog is as long as the box is diagonal, which is crazy! The chili was poured all over I couldn't see it, so one star off for that. At first I thought it was just a chili order but some digging around you found the hot dog. Definitely have to use a fork and knife but it was delicious all around!",4,0,0,0,1
"I really love Tasty Pot and I'm giving 4-stars instead of 3 because I've been here so many times and have always had good experiences... except my most recent experience was subpar. 

For my last experience here: I came for dinner, wait was the usual hour. I ordered the kimchi pot mild. Kimchi pot came out and there was no spice whatsoever... it looked like the food was boiling in basic water. So I told them that I ordered mild (I've gotten mild before and it has NEVER looked like clear water) and they said that it was mild???? I honestly was not having it because it was literally not mild... it was truly just water. I think the waitress got it mixed up because my brother told her that my nephew didn't want spice in his hot pot and she ended up putting no spice in my hot pot. Overall, that last experience really bothered me.

Other times I've been - wait was usually an hour. I would get beef hot pot or kimchi hot pot medium. Food would be amazing, service was great, and the sauces were always to die for!!! They also recently added a new sauce, which also paired super well with the hot pot!! 

This won't be the last time I'll be going to this Tasty Pot location, but I was really unhappy when I got my flavorless kimchi pot...",4,1,1,1,1
"Chef's Experience is one of the best Chinese Restaurants in Hayward. It's interesting because you enter through the backdoor and you wouldn't expect it to be so nice inside. There's a nice size full bar that also has a few televisions so this is a good location to watch sports.

Personally, my go to for food here is the chicken chow mein, general tao's chicken and the potstickers. Super good!! Entrees are share size so expect large portions. The dishes are on the pricier side but the flavor of the food, the portion size and the nice atmosphere more than make up for it.

Also, if you're going here for drinks, the Flaming Volcano is a must try item. It's an alcoholic fish bowl drink that has flames in the center. It's a huge bowl so you can either drink it alone or share with others.

I just recently discovered that this place also serves Dim Sum so I can't wait to return and try out items from this menu.",4,0,1,2,1
"A popular place and located in a shopping center next to a laundrymat and Smart and Final. Large parking lot, but it gets filled quickly if you want to park near the restaurant. There was a line before opening for lunch and fills up quickly. 

They give you a menu book and order sheet. You can tell the regulars know to order quickly, otherwise service and your order may come out slower, but it was not a problem for our group.

The staff is definitely busy and sometimes you can get their attention eventually, but overall service was fine. They brought our water when we requested it and always checked and refilled the teapot.

Someone else order for the family, so this is my best recollection of entrees ordered.
Pork XLB (8 pieces) A+ juicy and perfect skin and pork flavor and texture. I recommend to get 2 orders...so delicious.
Vegetable dumplings B green skin and lots of greens inside, but not a lot of flavor.
Pork/shrimp dumpling A good flavor and texture.
Black bean fish A+ great flavor and fresh fish and definitely order a rice dish to soak up the sauce.
Spam fried rice A fluffy rice with bits of spam, peas and eggs
Honey walnut shrimp B+ Crispy shrimp with pecans over lettuce was good.
Bean paste noodles A You mix the sauce and noodles together...flavor and noodles were tasty.
Piggy buns filled with egg custard A the bun was perfect and the filling tasty, however, at $10. for 3 buns is expensive...but a treat.

Overall, the food is good and I would recommend this place....though it felt hectic for me bc the food came out fast one after the other. It would be nice to have it paced so I could enjoy each entree. 

I understand they want people in and people out quickly as there is always people waiting for a table. With this being said I will come back for their XLB and try other entrees.",4,0,0,0,1

"What an unassuming gem!

My wife and I ended up here per chance as we were walking along the gourmet ghetto. The winding steep stairs led up to a dated restaurant, and we were a bit nervous as we were the only customers. However, after we ordered our food, the fragrant spices wafted from the kitchen, and we immediately knew we were in for a treat.

Our tandoori chicken came out on a piping hot on a grill plate, and accompanied with a lime, pepper, and onions. The rest of the food looked absolutely perfect. Everything we ordered was fresh and well layered. The lamb was cooked to a perfect near medium, and the roti was subtly earthy.

The entrees are reasonably priced, and the menu, though not as expansive as other restaurants, has all of the staples one would hope to find. We will definitely be back!",5,0,2,0,1

I was flipping through the menu and it says that one bowl of noodles is ~850 calories (holy moly!!) Still worth the calories though haha! We shared the beef noodles and lamb noodles. The beef noodles were a thinner kind whereas the lamb one were a thicker kind and I liked both - the texture of the noodles is nice and chewy. My only negative point is that I think they put a decent amount of msg in the soup because my mouth had that lingering msg taste even hours after dinner.

All in all, a solid noodle place that is great for satisfying noodle cravings. Remember to bring cash!!!",4,1,1,1,1

The servers were all very kind and nice. Warning: menu is big ... so be patient to go through all items to pick especially the Maki sushi options. Haha ... we eventually had ""Oh my god"" and the ""Soju roll"". Both were delicious and we'll be sure to come back and try more. They also seem to have a good list of Sake options.",5,2,1,1,1
"Judging from the food, I would give it 4 stars. Judging from the service and the speed of the service, they have a lot of catching up to do, 2 stars. Even with only a few tables occupied on a late Saturday afternoon meal, the wait was still 20-25 mins. I noticed no ones really picking up the tables when people are done with the food. It was not until much later when the owner or manager had to clear the tables. 

Anyways, 

We had the regular buffalo wings, which were not too spicy but still very good. 

The Malaysian curry (dry), was excellent. I only ordered 6 of these but wanted more. It had just the right amount of spicy goodness to it. 

My least favorite, but I order the most was the garlic Parmesan. It was good, my wife and daughter really like it. But it was way too greasy, the amount of butter or olive oil they used soaked thru everything. Flavor was good, but after about three wings, you could feel the grease.

Lastly, we also had an order of garlic fries, which also had Parmesan cheese on it. Again, very good but super greasy. If you like the greasy fries, you would love it.

Overall, will be back to try the different flavors, but I might order ahead and eat it at home until they get better with the service and speed.",4,4,5,5,1
"By the name alone and its location, I didn't have high expectations. I thought this was going to be a run of the mill restaurant in the mid-Market area. Surprisingly, this place was crowded at 530 pm and there was a 40 minute wait for a table on the day of my visit. It seems this is a popular place for the Orpheum Theater crowd, which located a block away. The wait was actually shorter than expected and we were seated in about 25 minutes.

The menu offered homestyle type foods--sandwiches, meatloaf, burgers, salads, in addition to pastas, seafood, tacos and burritos nothing super fancy and they even offer a Hamilton themed menu.

We ordered the bulgogi loaded tots for our starter followed by the Korean tacos and the Marquis de Lafayette's Gumbo as our entrees. Note that the taco's cannot be split/mixed, despite 3 of the 4 taco dishes offered (beef, pork & vegetarian) were the same price (3 taco's for $12). The taco's had to be the same, no mixing & matching.

The tots were delicious, covered in a mildly spicy Korean sauce--just a slight kick afterwards. The flavor was addicting and you wanted ""just another bite"" with the bulgogi. The gumbo was very flavorful and tasty, lots of chicken, shrimp and sauce; I used --my rice to soak up the sauce from my dish. I was not disappointed with my meal and my friend throughly enjoyed the mahi mahi tacos, topped with Asian slaw instead of shredded lettuce and also with some spicy sauce.

Overall the food and dining experience was very good, the portions were generous and the price was very reasonable. Our server, Spencer, was very attentive. I would not hesitate to return to try something else on their menu.",4,0,0,1,1
"I've been here twice, once during regular lunch hours and then again for happy hour. Both times I have very good experiences with the service and the food. 

I got the poke nachos, onion rings, and the stupid silly sour beer. The poke nachos were really tasty and some places will leave their wonton chips super oily, but that wasn't the case here. It was a very nice balance of sweet and salty with the sauce. The onion rings were a little too salty, but other than that, no big deal. I couldn't decide on what sour beers, so they let me have some testers of a few of their popular ones. I went with the stupid silly sour beer and if you like sours, this one is just for you! It was super sour and tasted more like juice to me. 

Overall, I think I'll stick to happy hour for Yard House- it's pretty pricey when it's not happy hour.",4,1,2,2,1

"This is one of those places where I came in with low expectations because of Yelp but then left feeling satisfied and delighted. It's a solid pho place that will become part of my rotation for my pho cravings.

I got the Pho Tai Chin - pho with rare steak and lean brisket. When it came to the table I knew it was going to be good.

BROTH: A nice aroma of spices, but not too overpowering. The broth is mellowed out with the flavor of onions. It had just the right amount of fattiness that it coated your tongue but you wouldn't feel gross drinking the whole bowl.

Noodles were perfectly al dente. And at under $8.75 (before tax and tip) this is one of the more affordable bowls of pho in the Bay Area. I paid a total of $10.50 including tax and tip. The serving size was just right - I left feeling satisfied but not too full. If I was extra hungry I would order an extra serving of noodles

"I walked by this place, it's a bar first and foremost. I saw the sign that said fried chicken. I was hungry and love fried chicken so I figured I'd try it. I'm glad I did. It's very good fried chicken. Some of the other reviews state that the chicken is a bit dry, I agree but that didn't stop me from enjoying the tasty chicken. I think the establishment just wants to make sure the chicken is fully cooked. I'd rather have it a little dry than undercooked if you can't get it perfect.
The only other thing I had was the fries. They are horrible. Fries are easy to make so there is no excuse for soggy pieces of potato that have a mixture of seasoning that makes no sense and tastes just damn bad. But if your at a bar and you've had a couple drinks and you have a little buzzzz and your hungry, those fries, might, taste good.

"I can't say they are the best tacos I've ever had in life...but they are the best tacos I've had since moving the San Jose. I pulled up and thought this place looks like a hole in the wall...aka I knew there was something good going on here. There are maybe 8 tables so there isn't a lot of space to dine in. They have a typically menu but I came for one thing only...TACOS. I ordered three super tacos, one veggie, one al pastor and one chicken. These tacos come fully stuffed and will leave you stuffed as well. I break down a taco into two main components, tortilla and the stuffing. 

The tortillas at here are hand made and I could taste the difference. They are fluffy yet hold up very well to all of the toppings.They were one of my favorite parts of my meal. Every bite enveloped in a delicious tortilla. Of the three tacos the al pastor was my favorite. I really enjoyed the sweetness of the pineapple in combination with the smoky chile. The chicken was good as well. I liked the veggie too but it was my least favorite. These tacos were stuffed with meat and everything else. You might need a fork to eat anything that falls of the ends. 

I have been mostly disappointed by the tacos since moving the SJ but after having these tacos I know where I'll bring friends and family.",4,0,3,1,1
"Before entering Lake Chabot Public Market for the first time, I was super excited to shop for local items not found in mainstream markets.

They had poke, ramen, boba, ice cream, and Korean.

"Have visited Gen numerous times in the past, so thought it's about time to go ahead and leave them a review after my recent visit this past Thursday.

The decor of the place feels like it is appealing towards the nightlife crowd, and it looks more like a club, than it does a restaurant at times. Neon lighting in some places, not too bright, the waiting area is basically just a dimmed hangout spot while you wait to be seated. They also have a digital list at the front of the restaurant, so when it gets busy, at least you can see where you are on the list if you want to get an idea of the queue, albeit, may not always be 100% accurate. Numerous seating options such as booth, two person, four to six, and much larger tables for bigger groups. They also have a macaroon ice cream bin at the front, but you'd have to purchase it up there at the front counter since it's a separate vendor (I know, weird).

The pricing of the place is fairly straightforward for a KBBQ AYCE. It's been the same price ever since it's opened, $25 for dinner, and $17 for lunch. The lunch menu is slightly smaller than the dinner menu, with some of the more premium meats missing from the list, but most notably, the galbi isn't included, so if you were going there for galbi, make sure to not do the lunch menu, or you may be disappointed since it's kind of a staple for KBBQ, not to say, their other stuff isn't delicious.

The service here is generally pretty good. When they get busy, it may take a bit longer for the server to get around at times, and take awhile for them to get your order in, or to change out your grill, and replace small dishes/salad/water. Usually though, there's so many people walking around, you can flag someone else down, and they can pop in your order too, since they send the orders digitally to the back to prepare your plate, so really anyone could do it for you. The same pretty much goes for the grill change, which, usually there's a specific person who comes around with a stack of grills, ready to change multiple tables, and not just their own so you won't be stuck cooking a fully charred surface. Of course, may still take awhile at times, so just be aware that may still happen. The managers here are also all pretty friendly. I've yet to actually have a problem with the management here, as when I have had problems, they've always come by to resolve them in a responsible manner, so it's appreciated.

Now, let's get to the good part; the food.

There's a lot of items on the menu, so I'll just be going over some of my favorites from the list. Here are some of my personal recommendations from the meats: Galbi, Premium Steak, Cajun/Garlic Chicken, and the Pork Cheek. 

Disclaimer: Many of their other meats are good too, just not listed above or below.

The Galbi is delicious, as the meat is pretty good, but the flavoring of the meat is really what brings it out here. I mean, isn't that really the best part about galbi is the flavors? One thing to note though, make use of the scissors, as the fat on the galbi here is really chewy, and for those who don't want to just chew for days, or have weak teeth, I'd recommend cutting it off during the cooking to make sure you don't have to deal with that. The Premium Steak is always a good one here as well. The meat is tender, and overall just delicious. There is a downside here too though, and that their premium steaks always seem to have tendon in the middle, and unchewable sliver of fat outside, so again, will need to make use of the scissors if you're not fashioned for a marathon of chewing. Their Cajun/Garlic flavors are both delicious, so while I noted chicken for them, it'll also work with the other meats as well, so no worries there. And the surprising favorite of mine here is actually the Pork Cheek. This dish has sort of evolved throughout the time when Gen has opened. It started out at super thinly sliced pieces of the pork cheek, but it was a nightmare to cook, as they were so thin, sometimes they'd even fall through the slits of the grill. The next form were slightly bigger pieces, still thinly cut, but at least now it didn't take forever for you to pick off each piece on the plate, and was delicious once it was cooked. The most recent form from this Thursday were finely cut thicker pieces, as seen in the photos, and I must say, my favorite version of them all. The way the fat and the meat charring together, it's just so crispy and meaty as soon as you take a bite out of it.

Overall, Gen is a great place for you to be if you want tasty AYCE KBBQ. While it is inconsistent at times, especially when they're busy, having been here more than a handful of visits already, overall, they are fairly consistent from the service side of things, and also from the food side. Just make sure to get here early, or much later (like after 10, they open late), or else you may be in for a bit of a wait, but if you're out with a big group, might not be the worst place to be anyways.",4,1,1,1,1

"This restaurant offers a wide variety of tasty Northern Chinese dishes including steamed pork dumplings/xiao long bao or commonly refer to as XLB.

It's located off of Steven Creek Blvd at a small corner of a strip mall. It's also not a very big restaurant (seats roughly 60-70ish) and can get really crowded during lunchtime.

- Burmese tea leaf salad - Really fresh and bright in flavor with nice twist of Chinese tea leaves
- Pork Xiao long bao (8) - Delightfully juicy and yummy
- Sauteed ""A"" choy with garlic - Generally a great dish but the veggies are a bit old and out of season
- Pan fried buns (6) - Crispy on one side and plump on the other with Lucious pork filling
- Fish and pork dumplings - dumpling wrapper made with squid ink. Looked more tempting than how they tasted.
- Spiced beef - Good dish if you like sliced beef with tendon
- Shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup - Definitely has appeal for those looking for wonton and noodle with lots of broth.
- Honey walnut prawns - breading is too thick and hard. Not very appetizing. 

It's really great to have access to another place for getting XLBs and tasty Chinese dishes. 

Parking might be a bit tricky as there are limited spaces in the front shared with multiple vendors. Rear parking is also available with a single narrow lane shared by dual-directional traffic. Roadside parking might be more preferable.",4,1,1,3,1
"If you're looking for a great tapas restaurant in the heart of San Francisco, then I would invite some friends along and make a reservation to Bask. Whether it's for lunch or dinner, this place is always booming with customers and the menu is sure to make your mouth water! For drinks, the sangria choices (red, white, pink, etc) are amazing! Highly recommend ordering any of them to complement your meal.

Some of the notable highlights of the meal were the Paella Royale and the other small dishes that our table shared. At $35, it serves about 3 people comfortably and may not look like a huge portion, but the dish is loaded with mussels, shrimp, squid, clams and whitefish. We also had other small dishes that I would suggest like the Iberico Bellota Ham and the Prawns, so keep in mind... order more plates if you haven't had your fill.

The ambiance was great and the staff was attentive. Only thing I wish could have been better is communication between the staff - we had 3 different people tending to us and we would place an order with one person and then get asked right after what we ordered by another person and have to repeat. We also were told that another person would come talk to us about a drinks order and then they didn't ever swing back around - it just felt a bit disjointed!",4,0,0,0,1

Mine was good but not a strong ginger flavor I'd that's your preference. We decided on the Thai-style Brussels sprouts and the tamarind prawns and one side of rice to split. The server brought out a shrimp chip basket that was appreciated. The brussel sprouts seemed to have been steamed and were not crispy as I had hoped. The sauce was delicious and paired well with the prawns. Prawns were the highlight of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was tangy. Would recommend this order!

Pretty good food. But wow oh wow is the place a dump. Garbage cans full every time I go there. They are overflowing before they get changed. Tables always dirty and you end up cleaning them yourself.

Count the customers and the money they spend during the peak hours. The owners put zero into the upkeep. Very sad. This place makes it only because hollister has no other decent Mexican food. My advice is get it to go. This place will remain the same until another business pops up and has good food and clean a business.,4,0,1,0,1

"So...I have passed by this place a ton of times and have been dying to try it. I will say that it's not too bad. I have been to New Orleans and nothing beats it, but this is a great place to get your cravings satisfied. 

So let's begin:
- Venue: The venue is quite nice. It definitely has the Louisiana feeling to it. there is a variety of seating (booth, table, bar, etc.). We opted for the bar and I enjoyed it as it was quicker seating and I got to see how the drinks were made. 
- Food: I ended up getting the Cajun Mixed Grill and it was alright. The potatoes were blander than I expected. The shrimp could have been pipping hot...it was kind of luke warm. The BBQ though was absolutely delicious. My friends enjoyed their dishes. (Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Jambalaya). The desserts (beignets and bread pudding) were absolutely delicious. Beignets reminded me of my time in New Orleans. 
Service: Very kind, attentive, and helpful. I love testing the server's knowledge of the food and the wine pairing. They did a great job. I enjoyed my food overall. 

I look forward to coming back.",4,0,2,1,1
"Wow. Very nice food! 
Helpful servers!

"We've been here a few times now and it's one of our favorite places for fish. Great place to take the kids for a healthy meal.

The seared scallops, shrimp skewers, and swai are our favorite. The clam chowder is also good, but salmon has been dry a few times. With the adult meals you can choose 2 sides. I usually get white rice and grilled zucchini, but their fries are decent too. 

The kid's meal is only $5.75 and comes with a drink. It's a good portion of fish with the kid's meal and I just give them some of my zucchini. 

You order at the counter and then pick up your food there when your buzzer goes off. 

Their food can take a while to cook, but that's ok with me because it means they're cooking it fresh. I usually get the sauces that come with the fish on the side. I don't really need the sauces. It already tastes good without them. They also have lemon wedges, cilantro, and other sauces on the side by the drinks.",4,0,0,1,1

"Today's one of the hottest days in the city. And what does my dad want for dinner? Ramen.

And it was a good call!

I can see why the lines are long for this place. The ramen is very good! I had the Tori Paitan Ramen. And I was amazed at the first spoonful! It was creamy and earthy, and rich with the duck chashu. And the pork was silky. I don't even like kale, but the kale in the ramen was pretty good.

We came just in the before the dinner rush, but since the place is small, the wait time can be awhile, especially for a larger group. It's advised that you look at the menu ahead of time so you can order right away. We waited about 15mins, which is standard. And we got our ramen quickly since we ordered right away. 

Since it was really hot outside, it was also hot inside. But eating the ramen basically matched my body temperature to the hot weather. I was sweating, yes, but it was bearable. 

I would love to come back here again and try their clear broth ramen.",5,1,5,4,1
"Begini was a great surprise. I test a dim sum place by their shrimp rice noodle. Their rice noodles were soft yet held together nicely. The shrimp was huge and fresh. I was in love from the first bite. 

The shrimp dumplings were also good with a thin wrapper. Shu mai was so big, the size of a plum! Yum. 

Slightly disappointed by the stuffed eggplant though. The shrimp was fried and had a texture I didn't like. But the bean curd in oyster sauce made up for it. The portion was big. I left full and leftover for a snack later. 

The service was friendly and attentive. I mistakenly ordered chicken feet and they immediately made the correction without any fuss. Oh btw their yellow mustard is nose-running hot. Be careful. 

I'll definitely visit again to try their salt and pepper ribs.",4,1,1,3,1
"First, there were the early saloons and taverns of the Wild West; then, there were the Irish pubs and Spanish tapa bars. The Japanese came out with their very own izakaya, likened to a pub or tavern but encompassing a little more. It's a unique and vital cornerstone of Japanese work-hard, play-hard food culture. That said, newly opened Izakaya Mayumi on Clement, like most other izakayas in town, is a little different from Japan and seems to be more ""family"" and date night oriented rather than salarymen. But don't get me wrong, IM holds itself out as an izakaya and is well stocked with sake and booze. My problem is really my doctor. He was dead serious to put me on the wagon years ago and I'm unable to drink and nosh like I'm supposed to!

The menu is not as extensive as most other izakayas. Yakitori (grilled meats on skewers) was prominently missing. Not a biggie! We started off with something mellow like sashimi before my taste buds had a chance to spring into life.
1. From the blackboard specials, we ordered 6 pcs of Salmon Sashimi for $18. Kinda pricey without knowing the species and origin. The one server that seemed knowledgeable shed some light - ""Canadian Salmon!"" Was it farmed or wild, Atlantic or Pacific? I dunno! The taste however was just what I feared! Middling! (3/5)
2. Most people don't care for octopus leave alone octopus balls! Takoyaki ($8) is a great snack food sold widely by street vendors in Japan. It's a batter made from flour, mixed with tiny octopus bits and shaped like balls made by using a special molding pan. IM's rendition was tasty without over dousing the balls with kewpie mayo and Japanese Worcestershire sauce. (4/5)
3. Agedashi Tofu ($9) is lightly fried tofu served in a flavorful tsuyu (sweet soy) sauce and popular in izakays. This was a crowd pleaser and it's no wonder the price of tofu has skyrocketed in recent years! The traditional toppings are bonito flakes, and grated daikon radish. I would like it better with a tad less cornstarch. Nonetheless, still crunchy around the edges. (4/5)
4. Corn Tempura ($8) was crunchy, addicting and should go well with beer. Green tea salt sprinkled on top allowed the delicate aroma to permeate the air leaving a subtle saltiness and sweetness (from the corn) on the tip of my tongue. Good but not the best. (3/5)
5. The next appetizer Sazae Aemono ($7) was a jaw dropper. If you love escargots (land snails), you would love sazae (whelk sea snails)! They were both texturally similar in terms of chewiness and crunchiness and both oozing with abalone-type umami. The difference was of course in the prep. This dish didn't call for butter, garlic and parsley but lightly stir-fried with julienned red onions in a homemade killer spicy sauce. It was intentionally done a tad salty so you can wash that down with more sake. Kampai! (4/5)
6. This is the peasant part of me that loves the rustic Japanese style of simmering and braising white fish. On the special board, the white fish was Tai Aradaki, a red snapper. Without sounding gross, it was the head only (sans body) of a 2.5-pounder at $38 a pop! It was a rip off I felt but I decided to splurge anyway for nostalgic reasons as it brought back fond memories of my childhood dinners. Asians prize fish heads for their tender meat and delicate flavors. The simmering sauce was the age-old ""Nitsuke"" sauce concocted from soy, sake, mirin and sugar, which can work just as well with fish fillets. The fish was a little briny tonight and adding more slivers of ginger would be an easy fix. (4/5)


Overall, the food was pretty pedestrian and not good enough to justify these prices. Parking was tough but not impossible. Service was amateurish and the ambiance minimalistic. More like 3.5 stars rounded up.",4,16,21,21,1
"Definitely one of the best fried chicken in the area. Whenever I crave for fried chicken and don't want to go somewhere too far, I come to Vons. They don't have any nice decorations in the restaurant or anything but who cares - their fried chicken is on point. I like how they have different kinds of fried and oven chicken with your choice of wings or drums - with the crispy fried as my favorite. 

For sides, I have had their sweet potato fries which are also good but I don't recommend ordering their kimchi fried rice it's bland. 

If you want to order to-go, do call in advance for your order, then your order will be waiting for you to pick up when you arrive :)",4,1,5,4,1

"Pho Play is located in the ""580 Marketplace"" with Safeway, Panda Express, and many other shops, but most importantly, a large parking lot. 

Nice, contemporary decor, easy-to-order menu, quick service, and great food. We really enjoyed our dining experience at Pho Play today for lunch.

This isn't a table service restaurant, so you order at the counter and then they assign you a table, which worked well. After sitting down, our food came out quickly. 

Portions were generous for the price, clean presentation, food was on point. My husband enjoyed his pho and said the broth was flavorful. I loved my Vermicelli with Grilled Chicken and egg (well-done at my request). The Grilled Shrimp Rolls were just ok (what you see is what you get...nothing special) and the peanut sauce was too sweet for me, but husband said it was fine.

Another plus is that they have a self-serve condiment station and to-go boxes available, too.

We'll be back to try other items on the menu!",4,0,1,0,1

Bass was still perfectly cooked and delicious. 
The garlic noodles, extremely garlicky but the best in the city in my opinion. Seasoning on point! 
Papaya salad. So fresh and delicious! Crunchy, yummy! 
Beef dish: can't remember what it's exactly called but it was so tender and so beefy!
Chicken: so good you'd think it's duck!
Imperial rolls: deep fried tasty goodness! Heavy on the black pepper!
Green beans: solid. Not the best but not the worst. 
Crab: stars of the night. Black peppercorn crab was delicious. Heavy black peppercorn flavor! Loved it. Also really enjoyed the other crab dish --definitely had a lot of butter in it and garlic too. The sauce was SO GOOD. OMG. Mixed it with rice too -- definitely try this trick. 

The whole feast ended with some fried bananas and ice cream. Tasty!

"Updated review: 

This original Orenchi location is still my fav ramen for the following reasons:

- 18 hour rich pork broth
- chewy al-dente noodles
- perfectly soft egg

"Walking into this taqueria, it has a very 90s feel to it. I always come to this location because a crispy taco is inexpensive ($3.10) and fills me up. It's not the best taco I've ever had, but for the cost, it's a cheap meal. 

When I'm feeling particularly hungry, I'll just eat the chips and salsa from the salsa bar. I love that they do not charge for the salsa bar and it's a help yourself station. They have a good variety of salsa; the salsa verde is my favorite. The chips are thicker than other restaurants and they're perfectly crunchy (reminds me of pita chips).",4,0,1,1,1

I almost always get the special with wings and Kim Chee fried rice. The rice is excellent, but wish they have a little more. The chicken is perfection. It's both cripsy and crunchy. Great flavor. Juicy. Just straight goodness. 

The Korean lady that runs the place is real nice. The vibe inside is weird though. Not much character. But I usually don't linger anyway.

My wife and I started with the Mac n cheese as an appetizer, which was velvety and smooth. It had a lot of flavor without being overly heavy. 

I had the Bavette, which was cooked to perfection. My wife had the flavorful oxtail.

We ordered the sampler, mansaf, touk kabab and couscous! We loved each and everything except the couscous. It was tad too salty, had too many veggies and too little meat.

"Craving a hot bowl of pho the other day, I opted to give DaNang a second try since there really are no good pho places in Albany! :( like why! Apparently, the owner now is the original OG DaNang owner who started this place in 1983, that's so cool! Stepping inside the restaurant, the place is cozy and very clean. 

When I ordered the pho last time and it was unfortunately way too salty, so I decided to try their bun bo hue this time. I am a bun bo hue super fan and I have had this spicy beef noodle dish at many different places and all over the Bay Area. (my favorite bun bo hue is at Pho King in Oakland). After trying out DaNang's bun bo hue, I am very happy to say that their bun bo hue is absolutely delicious, slightly spicy, and so so flavorful! The broth has the perfect balance of spice, savory, sweetness, and the beefy flavor. Adding in the bun bo hue garnishments, basil, mint, thinly chopped cabbage (only for BBHs!), and lime, made the broth even more fragrant and flavorful. The soup was still pipping hot after I put in all the herbs. I also noticed their bun noodles are a little different than other places I've tried, it's a bit more chewy, softer, and smoother, really really good bun noodles.

So happy to find a new authentic pho place that serves delicious bun bo hue and so close to home too! I will be back to try their bun rieu and other delicious vietnamese noodle soups. My all time favorite is still the bun bo hue though, since I'm a spice addict. :)",4,0,3,2,1
"The shop is kind of hard to find but I'm glad I found it. I was originally coming to this plaza to get Korean fried chicken but instead I passed by this shop and I felt like I had to come here. 

So the atmosphere is chill, everything, they play sports on the tv and the music is on the mid levels where it's not loud or low but just right where you can enjoy the music if you're by yourself or if you want to have a conversation with someone. 

Now, for the food, I got the Spicy Char Siu ramen with combo C which included Char Siu on the side. The broth was spicy and for me, it was just the right amount of spiciness where it has a good strong kick but it doesn't overpower the flavor. 

The char siu in the ramen was tender and the soup base was delicious. It has the familiar toppings of ramen but had its own taste to it too which made it different from other places; which I like. It's own flare. The char siu on the side, was absolutely delicious, the difference between the char siu in the ramen and the char siu on the side is the crispiness of the outer layer. The outer layer gave you a nice crust to crunch on, the inside was so tender, you can pull it apart with your chopsticks; the sauce was a mixture of sweet and salty which complimented the char siu completely well. 

As for service, the staff was friendly, welcoming and attentive; it gave off that traditional Japanese ramen shop vibe where the chef and the staff both say ""Welcome in!"" This is definitely a place I will go to again",5,1,3,4,1

Tried the sampler (about $24) with brisket, pulled pork, ribs and beans. Hefty in price and in volume. However, this sampler did last me almost 3 meals. 

Pulled pork felt dry. I liked the brisket, but wifey felt that it reminded her too much of beef jerky. Lol. We both agreed that the best thing was the ribs. Nice bbq sauce. Started with mild sauce, but that was just a tease so quickly added the medium one.

But you know what I do not like? Rude, lousy customer service. The short asian girl with dark hair and pointy eye liner. She just seems so snotty and unfriendly. She also pairs that unfriendliness with an eye roll. PERCEPTION is everything girl. You are surrounded by young, hip customers and co-workers so at the least be cordial. She literally greeted me with a ""can I see you your receipt?"" NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE but THREE TIMES. I guess third time is NOT the charm. 

The only reason why I am giving you 5 stars is because I really really like Bonchon. Also because the two guys working the register with her (ugh) have been amazing during my last two visits on separate nights. The first time it was the Filipino guy and today it was the tall, light-skinned guy. The latter also informed that if I had shown my receipt next door that my boba would have been half off or something. Not too sure so don't quote me on that.

"Across Los Gatos-Saratoga Road from the hustle-bustle downtown of Los Gatos, PintxoPote is tucked in to a quiet row of shops on Santa Cruz Avenue. Plenty of parking is available in the lot in front of the restaurant. This place is one of the best-kept secrets of Los Gatos! I can't say enough good things about it - but I'm certainly going to try.

I was a little nervous about trying this restaurant, as some of the reviews on here are less than stellar, but I honestly found that most of the complaints people had were just outright untrue! All of the food is flavorful; you're not going to get a run-of-the-mill meal, but it will definitely blow your mind. It's a fantastic representation of basque-style food that made me want to hop on a plane and go visit Spain! 

If you'd like to try this place, I would recommend making a reservation, as it is very popular. The night I went, for example, they had 80 reservations lined up! The interior of the restaurant is relaxing and welcoming, and the staff are very friendly and talkative; they are always willing to give advice on what to order (and which wines will go best with your pintxos!). The open kitchen is surrounded by bar seating, and is very clean. The single restroom is located in the back, and is also spotless. Now, for the food:

This is a basque-style pintxo restaurant (pintxo is similar to tapas), with an emphasis on using fresh ingredients and seafood. From what I understand, the menu changes, depending on what ingredients are in season. They also have an extensive menu of wines. Everything I tasted was amazing! Here's what my table ordered (wine pairings included):

Round 1: 
Gilda: Anchovy, guindilla (a mild spanish pepper pickled in vinegar that looks kind of like a picked green bean), and a green olive on a long toothpick. This was the most savory of the dishes in the first round. The anchovy was cured in salt, the guindilla provided a great pickled flavor, and the green olive topped it off quite nicely!
Mejillones En Escabeche: Mussels, vinegar, and pimenton. Marinated in a very flavorful mix of spices. Served de-shelled at about room temperature, and have such a unique flavor and texture that they honestly don't even taste like mussels! I would definitely recommend this dish. C'est fantastique!
Indurain Blanco: Bonito tuna belly, boqueron (white anchovy), guindilla, green olive, onion, and bell pepper on a long toothpick. This pintxo is meant to be eaten in one bite; the tuna and white anchovy provided great fish flavor and texture, and the veggies added interest to the dish, both visually and for taste.
Boquerones: White anchovies in olive oil. I love anchovies, and PintxoPote really knows how to serve 'em! White anchovies are marinated in olive oil and citrus instead of salt, giving them a very delicate flavor that lets the fish really shine.
Wine: 2015 Hazana Reserva
The suggested wine went great with all of the dishes, but it went especially well with the mussels. I can't say enough good things about our waiters' knowledge of wine pairings!

Round 2:
Albondigas De Cordero: Lamb meatballs. These are served three to a plate, and had such a great smokey flavor, with a deep spiciness that reminded me a bit of an adobo sauce. I would definitely recommend ordering these if they are available.
Setas Al Ajillo: Shiitake and king oyster mushrooms in garlic and parsley olive oil. Now, I am not a mushroom fan... but these were awesome! They are served on a skewer, and have a great texture and salty flavor.
Pulpo A La Plancha: Octopus served with a creamy cauliflower puree. It was cooked so perfectly, it wasn't rubbery at all, and the cauliflower sauce was so flavorful! 
Pani Cabra A La Plantxa: Goat cheese topped with pistachio, with both passion fruit and sherry vinegar reductions. This is the prettiest pintxo I've ever had! The goat cheese is lightly fried, giving the top and bottom a thin, cheesy crust.
Wine: 2010 Batllet Artai Gratallops

Round 3:
Tortilla De Patata: Potato and onion omelette. Tasted great by itself, and even better in a bite with any of the variety of cured meats served with it. 
Entrecote De Buey: 30-day dry-aged NY steak. Served with potatoes. Cooked medium-rare (so perfect!). This was my favorite dish of the night. They do their chimmichurri sauce right! : )

Round 4 (Dessert): Both served with vanilla bean gelato.
Torrija Caramelizada: Caramelized soft bread soaked in vanilla and cinnamon cream. It was great; I would describe it as a mix between bread pudding and creme brulee. It's also got a great cardamom flavor in there. 
Torta De Chocolate: Chocolate cake with almond slices. This cake uses almond flour, which adds such a great texture and taste to the dish.

TLDR: Great food, atmosphere, and staff; very clean. All dishes are wonderful and flavorful; follow your waiters' advice about dish suggestions and wine pairings.",5,1,5,7,1

"I was craving a good filipino breakfast even before they opened their doors this morning! We've grabbed breakfast here before and their cooking tastes like you are back home.

They have a great selection of items, so the downside is that you may find that it's hard to choose. Luckily, their ""silogs"" (rice plates) can be ordered with white or garlic rice and 1, 2, 3 or 4 items/meat, which I took to go and is enough for 2 ppl to share:
- garlic or white rice
- 2 sunny-side eggs
- longanisa - (3 pieces) tastes the way you want it to!
- tortang talong (eggplant omelet) yummy!
- daing (seared-fried marinated milk fish) yummy!
- bistek (flat iron steak cooked with onions, lemon and soy sauce, like my mom and i make!)

I ordered food to go and it would take about 10 mins so I went next door to their sari-sari store, which is like a local market where you can pick up frozen items to cook at home like lumpia, longanisa, drinks (cantaloupe, halo halo), snacks or ingredients for home cooking.

I think it was the owner who I spoke to outside of the store and he was a really nice gentleman. There are also really nice reviews of him, so I assumed that was him. I should have introduced myself and asked his name - - next time! His family's hard work has definitely paid off.

- Prices are fair for the bay area. They use quality ingredients and your food is made to order.
- I've read where customers either have to wait for their food or their table, so expect longer waits during peak meal times. (the wait is worth it)
- Their ""kamayan"" is popular (family style meals) beautifully set on the table
- The restaurant is small, but they have long tables so they can accommodate some large parties
- Parking lot is small and slots are reserved for each of the merchants",5,0,1,0,1
This is the best Indian food we have ever had! No exaggeration! We were there on a Monday night and the place was full except for a small table near the kitchen. Our waiter moved us to a window table as soon as it was available berfore we ordered. Everything on the menu looked good. I had the baby arugula salad and Mulligatawny soup with chicken. Husband had lamb dish that we shared. Portions are generous and service was very friendly and prompt. Don't miss this gem!,5,0,0,0,1

"We arrived at 4pm with a mid-sized group for happy hour. Although we weren't able to make reservations in advance (the restaurant was already booked up online) the server promptly sat us at a great spot upon arrival. Our server was very patient with a few later arrivals and immediately came by our table to take new food and drink orders. The service was otherwise speedy and friendly.

The happy hour menu features a fairly wide selection of food and drink options (I recommend the porch pounder cocktail and apple moonshine). We also went with a few items from the main menu - the blackend shrimp was absolutely worth skipping out on a happy hour special. Note that food service doesn't begin until 5pm.

There was some ambient noise from other guests and an awesome playlist, but not so loud that you need to shout to be heard. There's also a jazz lounge in the back if you're more interested is entertainment than conversation. Highly recommend Hazel for a drink and lighter bites with friends and co-workers.",5,0,0,0,1
"Been here many times through the years and saw the transformation to how and what the restaurant looks like now. Always a busy place at the wharf and they still have the best clam chowder in a bread bowl in my opinion. My daughter is a huge fan of sourdough bread, so each time we are here she is in cloud 9 and we never leave this place without something sourdough to go! The whole place can get crazy busy and lines can get very long at any given time. But it does go quick! They have it down to a tee and we never have any issue with the service no matter how busy they are. Lots of tables and chairs but can be difficult to find a place to sit... but if you don't mind sharing a table with someone, you can find someone willing to share. This is definitely a place you should add on your list to visit when in SFO/Fisherman's Wharf area.",5,2,2,2,1
"Really like the food here Iv been here about three times now and have tried different plates every time and have not been disappointed but you have to have a reservation if your trying to go for dinner on Friday- Sunday Iv tried without a reservation and wait times are always over an hour.

"Cheese Board Pizza is really good. Is it the best pizza ever? I don't think so, but it is delicious and reasonably priced for the hype of this place. First off, vegetarians love this place because there isn't any meat used. If you're looking for a meat lovers pizza, this isn't the place. Also, they only have one option of pizza and a salad which changes daily. This makes the line move relatively quick but if you're not a fan of the daily pizza, you're out of luck. There was a lot of hype around the green sauce they have, but to be honest, I could give or take. It tasted more like green salsa to me which didn't jive as well. 

The ambiance is fun and vibrant as they have some outdoor seating in addition to a handful of tables indoors. My husband and I went on a Friday night and waited maybe thirty minutes or so. They seem to have a lot of live music though which is a major plus for when you're there. Overall, an enjoyable, casual place to grab a good pizza.",4,0,2,0,1

"SUMMARY
New to Concord bar/pub that's located in a somewhat struggling strip mall off Clayton Blvd. Really chill vibe, cool crowd, friendly staff, good selection of beers, and AMAZING lumpias!

BACKGROUND
Came here with fellow Yelpers Robert R and Lylah to have a beer. 

DRINKS and FOOD
First off they have over 2 dozen types of beers, so it was a challenge selecting just one :) I opted for my usual Pale Ale, but was provided a few samples before trying. I can't remember what I ended up with, but having a few samples to narrow it down was greatly appreciated. 

Little did we know that they served food, so we ordered a few to share. We ordered Catfish Sliders, Lumpias, and Tater Tots. Of the three, the Lumpias truly stood out. We ordered 8 and needless to say, they were HUGE. Not the skinny kind you get at your local 99 Ranch, but handmade (we learned from the waitress) by the co-owner who is Filipino. The sliders were great too, but the lumpias totally overshadowed all the other food we ordered. 

(So yes, order them :) 

ATMOSPHERE and CROWD
Very chill. I was hoping this wouldn't be a bro bar, but happily it turned out not to be so. 

RETURN VISIT?
We're trying to find an excuse to return with Robert and Lylah and others :)",5,4,9,5,1

"Cash only!!

Food: 3.5 Decent Chinese dessert place. It was my first time and I thought it was okay. The portion was smaller than I expected, but it was still not bad. We mostly got the desserts, and the fruits were decent. The ice cream from the fruit was interesting, it was more like shaved ice flavored ice cream from the fruit (we got the mango flavor). I thought it was okay, but my friends really liked it.

Service: 5/5 The service was excellent. Friendly and attentive. 

Overall, if you're looking for some late night snacks/desserts, this place is not bad since it opens till 2AM on the weekend.",4,0,1,0,1
"Went to Esin with my family for my younger brother's 23rd birthday today. Our server was fantastic, she was very knowledgeable about the menu and all of the specials.

We started off with the rock shrimp which was a nice compliment to the extra ordinary cocktail menu. I had the cool burn cocktail which was a perfect blend of cucumber and jalapeno. Sounds weird, but neither one was over powering, each component offered a refreshing taste to the pallet.

Then we had the orchard green lettuces which was amazing. The ratio of lettuce to blue cheese to cashew to fruit to dressing was perfect. I then had the gnocchi which was not heavy at all.

Lastly, I had the brownie and vanilla bean ice cream which just made the night that much more sweet.

The reason I gave them a 4 out of 5 stars is because the server didn't check up on us between dropping off our entree and asking if we would like dessert.

Overall it was a very nice experience and I will be going back in the near future.",4,0,1,1,1
"Ok every time I order take out and ask for wings only, I'm given combo LOL. 

Anyway, I love the chicken here. It's so crispy and moist. My go tos are the Honey Butter and Crispy Fried Chicken (soy garlic). There's also oven roasted chicken for all you health freaks. I tried the Garlic one, but the amount of sauce used was a bit overpowering.",4,2,1,0,1
"This a nice restaurant for special occasions. Food is great. We ordered the Seared Tuna with rice and bok choy in wasabi sauce. Big plate, very nicely seared and tasty. We also ordered the mushroom risotto, which was also good but a bit on the bland side. French white Chardonnay was crisp, a bit sweet and mellow just how I Ike it. 

Ambiance was ok. Tables are very close so it was loud and we can clearly hear conversations on both sides. Hard to have a private conversation

The place was quite full on Mon evening for dinner but we had reservations and was quickly seated. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The food took a while to come out. 

I felt that this place is a bit expensive but the food was very good.",4,0,2,1,1
"Came here last Wednesday for a small birthday dinner and had a great time! I'd recommend making a reservation if you're coming here in the evening - the restaurant is on the smaller side and seems to be pretty popular. It's also on the pricier side for the amount of food you're given, so I'd probably only go back for some
sort of occasion. 

We ordered a variety of different dishes -- the seafood paella, lamb sliders, scallops, and mushroom and ham croquettes. Our favorites were the paella, the scallops, and the mushroom croquettes! All were delicious. The lamb sliders were very good too and one of the most filling tapas we had. We also ordered two glasses of the sangria -- I'm not usually a fan of sangria, but this one had a fruity taste and was more sweet than sour. They also add chunks of real fruit inside!",4,0,0,0,1
Second day of its soft re-opening. Glad they are back in their modern new quarters. Restaurant was full. Food remains excellent and inventive. Salmon Wellington was superior. It is hard to prepare well. Please understand that they are getting out the kinks before the formal opening. The night one Yelp negative review was very inappropriate for a soft opening. So happy we have a quality restaurant in Almaden.,5,0,0,1,1

Will return to try more items. Lovely experience.",5,0,1,1,1
I like this place over the other wings spot in Bayfair. No charge for flats or drums no charge for sauces and wings are better tasting imo. Here's an updated picture of the Menu taken in 05/2019,5,0,2,0,1
"One of the best shabu place in the Bay Area. The broth is sooooooo good! I like getting the garlic miso which I think is the best! The meats come in regular, large, and sumo size. Honestly if you're really hungry, be prepared to get a sumo. The meat is really good here too. You have the usual option of ribeye or Kobe beef. Yum!!! It's delicious. An entree comes with your choice of meat, the veggies and rice. Pretty good. 

The service is also very good here. The staff are very attentive to your needs. Could've been 5 stars but I had to take one off because of their location. 
Their location is so tiny. Large parties is not good here as the place is so small. The wait can get crazy ridiculous too. I wish they had Yelp waitlist. But unfortunately you gotta go inside and get on the waitlist. The wait can go up to an hour or so. The most I've waited is 1hr and a half almost 2. All depends how busy they are and how extremely inconsiderate some people are when they eat. Lol.",4,0,1,1,1

"Wonderful, FAST food and excellent service!

My wife and I had dropped off our car at Smogsters a block south around 11am on Thursday, September 5th. We had not had breakfast and asked the clerk at Smogsters for a recommendation.

H&J had formerly been Nibs for many years, but we'd heard that it had been renovated and reopened recently. Our grumbling tummies spurred us quickly down the block.

The space is sunlit, clean and cozy. It really feels like a neighborhood joint. Not too small, not too big. The tables and chairs and simple varnished wood. I liked that the seats of the chairs are contoured for your backside!

Our server, Mason, was a delightful and enthusiastic young man. We made our selections quickly and the food came out QUICK. I suppose that this is due to it being a Thursday, but regardless, we were impressed!

Mason was very solicitous, but did not hover. His sense of humor was lively, and he and I had a geek-out conversation over Pokemon Go, as he saw me playing the game and we chatted extensively about the game and the local community of players.

The food was delicious. I got the Chorizo Scramble, and my wife got the Chilies Omelet. Both were wonderful, and I was particularly pleased to find one of my favorite hot sauces, Cholula, available table side.

I could imagine this place being swamped on the weekends, but if you can go during the week, it is a tranquil and sublime experience.",5,0,0,0,1
"Simple, straightforward, delicious - that's mama in short. 4.5/5 stars 

When I heard that there is a new spot that does a 30$ pre-fix menu centered around pastas, I obviously had to check it out. I am happy to report that mama serves rustic and honest food which is a total bang for your buck. 

You get a choice between a soup/salad, veggie/meat pasta, cake/gelato. Between the 4 of us we tried everything on the menu. Both the soup and salad were great, none the clear winner. Amongst the pastas, the spaghetti with beef-pork sugo was certainly appreciated more. The sauce was robust and the noodle perfectly al dente. The linguine with squash and ricotta was tasty, but it could have been better. There were just a few pieces of the squash (I would have loved to see a few more or even more variety of squash). As for the dessert, the polenta cake and the gelato were a great end to the lovely meal. Oh and how can I forget the warm, crust bread - noms! 

The restaurant has a cozy feel to it, and the pretty lights with the greenery add a nice touch. Staff is attentive and friendly. They also have a great wine list with explanations about the wines (which is always helpful). Our Sangiovese paired well with the meal. 

The few things that leave to be desired - they don't take reservations, for being a short pre-fixed menu the food can take a while to show up, and for a restaurant that focuses on pastas I was just a little sad to see that they don't serve fresh pasta.",4,2,5,6,1
"Other than the churrasasearia in Punte del Este, Uruguay, this is my go-to-place for steak, hands down! And the ambience: a redwood interior!

Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and promptly served their warm, freshly baked rolls with cinnamon butter. And a bucket of peanuts was on the table!

My sirloin steak was absolutely mouth-watering, perfectly grilled. I ordered it medium rare, and that's the way it was served. With it, I got a baked potato that was split, a plus. I ordered a side of toppings. The broccoli was bright green and tender, and the young carrots were perfectly cooked.

The tall glass of red raspberry lemonade is my choice drink. This is the first time I have seen it on a menu. I liked it so much, I had a refill.

Three containers of rolls with cinnamon butter were complimentary!

My advice: Don't even think about it, GO! You will love your dinner!

"This is a review for Jupiter's event services. We recently had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Jupiter-- we wanted to share good brews and good food with our out-of-town guests and Jupiter has affordable per person pricing for large parties. Overall the service was good and of course the food was great! 

We are giving four stars though because we had some trouble due to miscommunications between managers on shifts. While we had no problem reserving our event for 30, I did notice that each time I received a response by email during the reservation process, we would get an email from a different person / manager. It seems that they have multiple managers who handle events. This did unfortunately affect our dining. While we were promised the patio area for accessibility purposes, when arrived we learned that we were being seated upstairs. This oversight, which could not work for all of our guests, was due to a lack of communication between shift managers. Jupiter was fortunately able to pull together seating outside along the alleyway and all of our guests were accommodated. I'm quite impressed they were able to pull that off on a packed Saturday.

I would recommend Jupiter for events, but be aware that you will be working with multiple managers and that this might lead to miscommunications.",4,0,0,0,1
"Today I checked Yelp to look for a new place to eat. This restaurant popped up with the perfect rating from three others. I was leery seeing the small amount of reviews but saw that one was given by a Yelp Elite Member so I decided to try this restaurant out.

We created our own combo with a pupusa, flauta, tamale, plantain, rice, beans and chips. Overall the food was really good with the pupusa being one of the best I've ever had! The Tamale was a little bland and could probably had been better with a little sauce added to it. All the food was made to order and came out hot. We requested the mild sauce with our chips but it was a little spicy for us. We were offered a plain sauce in its place.

Most drinks were served in bottles and cans some unique flavors probably popular with the Latino Community were available.

A man and woman team at the restaurant gave excellent service and were very accommodating.

The restaurant and bathrooms were clean. There was parking available.

I hope to come back soon.

I am going to focus on the many drink choices here! They are US, Mexican, and Salvadorian based ones. 

Aguas Frescas de Frutas Naturales (Natural Fruit Water based drinks) are very good and full of flavor.
Fresa (Strawberry), Chia Chan (Chia Seeds), OrChata (Milk based), and Jamaica (Jamaica Flower), Frutas (Pineapple, Mango, and Apple). The one I liked the best was the Frutas, it had tiny bits of the fruit in it. Some of the fruits were crunchy, like little treats in your drinks. The OrChata tasted like a melted Milkshake. The Chia Chan and Jamaica were a surprise to me, with unique sweet . I will be ordering these drinks in the future.

Other unique drinks include Jarritos' Tamarind, Jarritos' Mandarin, Jarritos' Fruit Punch, and Coconut Water.

I tried the Sidral Mindet, a Mexican Natural Apple Soda. It tasted liked a sweet apple cider which is carbonated. A nice change from the sodas you can find anywhere.

There are the usual Coca-Cola, Sprite, Squirt, 7Up, Pepsi, Red Bull, Rockstar, SunnyD (Tangy Original), Bottled Water, and Sparkling Bottled Water. 

In addition there is Mexico Bottled Pepsi and Coca-Cola.

So besides the culinary treats there are plenty of drinks to compliment your meal.",5,1,2,5,1
"Overall we had a decent experience at Jupiter. Bottom line would be overpriced pizza and appetizers. 

I went onto Yelp and I was really close to making reservations, but noticed they had some really strict guidelines. My advice, is don't! A reservation is absolutely pointless especially because it's self seating. Not sure if they have a hostess on Fridays, but they definitely didn't on a Sunday. 

Service was average and the food was pleasant. For starters we ordered the Hummus plate, Potato Wedges, Garlic Bread and the Fondue. All of which were amazing. The Hummus plate was a bit overpriced, but couldn't expect it not to be. 

We ordered a variety of pizza, the one that was a let down was the Galileo.

"The thought of deep dish pizza was too enticing to pass up so we came here around 6:30 pm on a Thursday night to give Capo's a try. The first thing to note is that this place is not very big - they were fully booked by the time we got there so we had to wait for a couple of seats to open by the bar. Luckily, we only had to wait 5 minutes or so as another couple was wrapping up. 

We got seated and the bartender gave us some menus to look over. I decided to get the El Chapo cocktail to start while my husband settled on a beer. I wasn't really a fan of my drink and it got watered down real quick. Luckily, the bartender mistakenly poured a class of Chianti for the group next to us that they didn't want, so he gave the glass to us instead on the house - score! The wine went really well with the pizza we were about to have. We then decided to get the garlic cheese bread as well as an 8"" Farmer's Pie to share. (We initially wanted to get the baked artichoke dish but our neighbors next to us got this dish and we saw that it was huge and decided to pass). The garlic bread actually ended up being way bigger than we expected it to be, coming with 7 big chunks of toast. However, we were starving so all of this disappeared in about five minutes. The dish was good, not great, and came with actual chunks of garlic topped on each piece. The flavor of the garlic had already been baked into the bread so it wasn't overwhelming. Our pie came out shortly after and while it didn't look big, it was more than enough to fill up 2 people with good appetites. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor combination itself, but it wasn't bad by any means. But my husband absolutely loved it and he's the harder one to impress typically. 

Overall, we left feeling satiated and as my husband said: ""not mad at all"". In addition, they offer live music during your meal so you get dinner and a show. Give Capo's a try for yourself!",4,2,4,2,1
"Yum! I genuinely didn't have any complaints for my experience here.

Sunday is the brunch tradition so I decided to try out Uncle John's Pancake House in Campbell. There is a small parking lot in the back, but because there are other storefronts in the plaza, parking might get full. You can join the waiting list on Yelp, which shows a live wait time. Thankfully, for a counter spot, there was no wait at 10 AM on a Sunday.

I tried the chunky monkey with the crepes. These were absolutely delicious. The crepes were thin yet had some fluff to them, and they were not overly sweet. The Nutella sauce wasn't as heavy as straight up Nutella, which I did appreciate it. There were strawberries and bananas on top, but they were also hiding on the inside of the crepes which meant that every bite would have fresh fruit. It was delicious and a perfect sweet bite to the meal.

I also tried the California Benedict. The eggs were poached to perfection; meaning that the egg would run as soon as you cut into it. There was a nice, thick cut of Canadian bacon, a juicy tomato slice, and a generous slicing of avocado. The hash browns were crisp and hot as well. The hollandaise sauce laid perfectly on top without going overboard and drowning the entire dish. All the flavors melded perfectly together.

Service was attentive and fast. Food was brought out quickly and I was out of there after only being there for about 45 minutes. 

Great spot, they have a seasonal menu and I plan to be back!",5,5,7,5,1
"Free sesame seeds and spicy pickled cabbage to add to your ramen as you like. I really enjoyed the spicy pickled cabbage. The waiter was very nice and explained to us how we could customized our ramen. I thought it was cool we could customize our ramen to our liking.

"Wow. That's all I can say. Wow. Now, I wish I could just leave the review like that but, ""wow"" really doesn't tell you anything. 

Let me begin at the beginning: chorizo scramble. I really regret that I didn't take a picture first. I was just so excited to eat it, I couldn't wait. What a beautifully colorful plate! Green, red, yellow, orange all enticing you to give your palette a treat. It really was love at first sight. The chorizo itself packed just enough heat without completely overpowering, that coupled with the sweetness of the red tomatoes and the slight taste of green onions made this dish amazing! Not at all salty and nice ooey gooey cheese in every bite to top it off. Yes. Cheese in every bite! Unlike other chorizo scrambles I've had, the cheese is not on top but mixed in for you to enjoy with each bite! If you get the chorizo, I recommend trying it with avocado. It really makes the dish even more delectable. 

Now I was a little disappointed that I didn't immediately see white bread on the menu. Instead, it's wheat, sourdough, biscuit and English muffin for your starch options. Well, if I could eat their wheat bread everyday, I'd never want for white bread. It was dense but in a hearty satisfying way. It's a hard bread but not hard like a bread that's been sitting out all day. And it has a slight sweetness that's very subtle but really just enhances the experience. You know what? I give up. I can't do it justice. You just have to try it for yourself. 

I don't know what it is about this place but all their bread items were so good! The waffle had a honey like sweetness to it, the biscuit was so fluffy, the English muffin was toasted and buttered to crispy perfection. It was amazing! I wanted to order extras to take home! 

The Turkey chicken sausage was also so good! Savory with a slight kick. And the potatoes and cooked with herby goodness. They're nice and soft so it's easy to eat a lot quickly. 

The service here is really great! Attentive waitstaff, very friendly and hospitable. The restaurant is not that big so I thought there would be a long wait but they get people in and out pretty quickly! The food comes out promptly so the line clears up fast. 

Great place to eat. So glad I got to try it. Can't wait to come back.",5,12,19,16,1
"This is the new ramen shop that's taken the place of Ramen Halu (RIP). Let's do the rundown:

Drinks: they have Anahi and Sapporo, but the only Suntory they have is the non-alcoholic ""all-free"" version. Weird, but they have Sapporo on tap, so it's fine. They also have a small but very welcome selection of sake and Japanese soda.

I got mini pork soboro don and the tonkotsu bowl with extra egg and chashu. You get two slices of chashu and can get two extra for $3. Not cheap, but acceptable enough.
The rice in the pork bowl was kind of dry, as was the meat. It wasn't bad, but very unremarkable.
The ramen, though...

These guys got two out of the three central elements spot-on. The broth is packed with flavor and is just rich enough. Very satisfying. The noodles are the thick kind and perfectly chewy. Also very satisfying.
The chashu was... okay. It wasn't bad, but it was a little overcooked. Still tasty and better than a lot of places.

All in all, definitely a solid ramen spot! It could use some minor improvements, but give it a shot. They just opened and deserve your business.",4,1,1,2,1
"They revised their pricing and made it better.

I love how they use a kind of pastry bun and create an enclosed burger where usually nothing spills out, but be careful, it's very hot since there is no ""venting"" when they put it all together.

Delicious, and very unique, I keep coming back here, one of my favorite burger joints now.",5,0,0,0,1
"This place is bomb! The bifteki pita is an ABSOLUTE MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Food is always served fresh, hot and made on the spot. 

Second time here and they don't disappoint with their food.


The bathroom is separate. Everytime I have gone to the one bathroom the toilet lid is up and the bathroom floor wet from water (???.... I'm hoping not urine). I don't eat in the bathroom, so this doesn't apply. I do wash my hands before eating. 

Enjoy their delicious food!

Omg, just tried the rigazola!!!!! Fresh! The best ever. Is that honey at the bottom??? My boyfriend is even wow-ing. I'm no longer sharing with him and getting extra for home. Dear God!! Thank you!",5,1,0,1,1
"I'm so glad this gem just opened in the neighborhood! With Shanghai dumpling king closing I was wondering where I could get my XLB fix, lo and behold Dumpling alley! 

Fianc����� and I came here on a Sunday around 115ish, we were seated right away and looked over the menu. We ordered the XLB, truffle XLB, Chinese donut with shrimp paste and spicy beef noodle soup! 

The regular xlb were perfectly porky and pretty juicy. The skin wasn't too thick and they were easy to eat, it came with 6 dumplings! I would get this again. The truffle xlb on the other hand was the exact opposite, there was no soup inside at all. It was a dry dumpling but you could taste some truffle in the filling. I would avoid this one, it only comes with 4 dumplings.

The Chinese donut with shrimp paste was amazing!! It was perfectly crispy and crunchy with a good amount of shrimp paste, the flavors melded together really nicely and it was good by itself or with the sweet chili dipping sauce. 

Spicy beef noodle soup was probably t the meal. While it wasn't a huge bowl, it was enough to share between us. The broth was actually spicy and really beefy. The pieces of beef were so tender and delicious! The noodles we weren't a fan of cause they were slightly wavy like ramen noodles. But they did absorb all that spicy goodness from the broth. So even just slurping noodles it had such a good kick of spice from the noodles! 

Overall, we loved everything we tried except for the truffle xlb. And the amount we ordered was the perfect amount where we weren't overly stuffed but just satisfied! Can't wait to come back here in the future!

Total for 2 w/tip: $48",4,2,4,3,1

"Came in the other day for lunch. I had been taking a while to come and visit because the waits around dinner were about 2 hours long and I did not want to do that. So one day Emmy sister took me for lunch. I was surprised on how crowded it was for a Sunday lunch. That's ok though because we waited about two minutes and got to pick between sitting inside or outside. It is pretty cold indoors so make sure to bring a light jacket. 

We ordered a couple things to share. I got a half yard and this was very reasonably priced. Then I shared the poke nachos and truffle fries. We also both got one street taco the Baja shrimp and Baja fish. Wow was everything so delicious! I will be coming back for those tacos and poke nachos. The nachos were a tad spicy but just ask it without the peppers. Yum I'm already to go back. The staff was very attentive to us as well. They were approaching us multiple times and got us things we asked for in quick time. I absolutely enjoyed coming here and ready to go back.",5,4,6,5,1
"Great addition to the South Bay hotpot scene! I came here because a pair of my married couple friends highly recommended this place after they visited a branch down in Los Angeles, and they wanted to try the new Milpitas branch with me when we were going out to dinner. I love exploring new AYCE hotpot places, so I was down!

We came on a Sunday evening, the day before Labor Day, around 6pm, and waited for about 20-25 minutes to be seated. They were prompt to take our orders, to bring us our soups, and to also bring us our platters of meat and help us identify which meat was which. Everything was absolutely delicious, and we enjoyed everything we ate. The bar where they had noodles, vegetables, tofu, and various seafood had a good selection! I really loved that they had a wide variety of noodles compared to many other hotpot places, including ramen, spinach noodles, udon, egg noodles, Konica brown noodles, and Sujaebe Korean pasta.

Their appetizers are a must try! We tried all four appetizers: gyoza, original chicken karaage, volcano chicken karaage (spicy), and japchae. 

We left very stuffed and satisfied with our dinner. I'm sure we'll be back!",4,2,2,2,1
"Great Belgian food! When we arrived, we were kind of reluctant to try it out because it was empty, but after reading the other reviews on yelp we thought it was worth a try and went downstairs.

"Quick poke stop which is on the better side of most poke chains.

Walked in Saturday afternoon with basically no line. Prices for small, medium, and large bowls seemed a bit more pricier than I am used to but the generous scoops of protein made up for it.

Large selection of fresh fish/crab along with toppings make this place great for a bite. What could be improved is allowing a single scoop of avocado or tamago without the extra 1$ cost. I understand charging more for extra scoops but I think avocado should be included.

Overall pleasant experience but nothing spectacular",4,0,2,0,1

 Picks:
Bulgogi bap ($16) bulgogi, Yukon potato, vegetables, fried egg, rice came in a cool skillet. Reasonable portion size and good flavors. Very hot spicy sauce!

Pimped ramyun ($18) takes a $1 cup of noodle and kicks it up a notch. It is presented spilled out onto a tray with green onions, mushrooms, and more, Really nice slice of Millionaire's Bacon.

Everything is made fresh, using fragrant herbs and spices. It's hard to choose what to eat. I do not eat red meat and did not have any problem finding fabulous dishes.

"To me, this is the best Korean BBQ in San Francisco. I know everyone says there are better spots in the South Bay and yada yada yada, but for the city, this spot is my fave.

The food itself is very good, as I've never once had a bad meal here. I will caveat that with the fact that I haven't explored the entire menu all that much. I've gotten BBQ meats (short rib is the best duh), japchae, bibimbap, hot tofu soup and some pancakes. All of them are delicious! I know there are folks here like ""dude, this isn't even close to the food in Korea"" well no shit since we are in San Francisco. If you tryna tell me the food itself does not in fact taste good tho, then you hella lyin! Just cuz something isn't as good as the best you've ever had doesn't mean it's not good.

We started with some excellent bread with their garlic dip. The bread is like focaccia, really tasty. I ordered the spaghetti puttanesca and it was really delicious with capers and olives. My boyfriend got the misto salad and the sausage and peppers on polenta appetizer, and he really liked it, particularly the salad. I also got a glass of wine and it was a pretty large pour.

"I had been waiting Teleferic to open in the old Calafia space. I heard about this place years ago after friends tried it in Barcelona, and then I heard it was in the East bay. 

The space is pretty big, but it was packed on a random Tuesday night - definitely make a reservation. On a warm night, the patio is a nice option. They have a full bar, but sangrias seem to be the favorite here, and they had a few different types. We tried the original, but they also had one with cava and another that was spicy. 

The menu is tapas focused with some larger format meats and paellas. Definitely share everything family style. 
- Croqueta de Jamon: generously sized croquettes with a good amount of ham inside; these were smooth and creamy inside and nicely fried outside
- Pulpo Teleferic: nicely grilled, good char/flavor and texture. The paprika potato pur�����e underneath was a good accompaniment 
- Gambas al Ajillo: 4 head on prawns, nicely seasoned 
- Cauliflower: with Romesco and a manchego cream. It was kindhen we got it, which was disappointing. I do appreciate the unique preparation, but I thought it could had used a bit more salt 
- Paella de Bogavante: a big lobster paella; I thought the rice needed a bit more salt. The flavor was otherwise good, and it had a lot of other ingredients like shrimp, asparagus, bell peppers, scallops, clams, etc 

For dessert, we couldn't decide, so we got the trio, which had the churro, the choco magic, and the Catalan French toast. The choco magic was definitely my favorite (chocolate ganache, Oaxacan chocolate). 

Service was super friendly and attentive with water refills, and our server was knowledgeable and just really pleasant overall.

It's no Barcelona, but it's probably the best tapas option I've had on the peninsula. Teleferic is a very welcome addition to the peninsula food scene.",4,1,1,1,1

Service: Probably the best part! The waiters were super patient and very nice to us in bringing us our food quickly and filling our waters. 

Ambiance: This place is very classy, very much a classic Thai place and located right next to a highway and post office.

"The famous pics of olive oil based yogurt is what brought me here on my 48 hour trip in SF. Limited indoor and outdoor seating but I would say tables flip quickly. On a Saturday night I waited about 10 mins in line, and was able to snag a high top seat right away. 

Not quite used to SF sporadic weather, I was freezing after a brisk walk so soup sounded lovely. Lemons, shredded chicken, olive oil? Count me in! I ordered a soup, lamb gyro wrap and an olive oil yogurt. Food was QUICK (less than 5 mins) and no wait for ice cream if you're dining in and would like it after you're done eating the main meal. 

|| Lemon chicken soup (can't remember the name): 5+ stars. This was the best part of the meal, and I it's extremely underrated here. I ordered a large bowl size, and it comes with a good amount, not tiny at all. The broth itself was delicious, it's like a cross between a standard American chicken noodle mixed with lemons and rice. The lemons were not overpowering. Loved this soup, and can't wait to try and replicate at home 

|| Lamb pita: 4.5 stars. I debated for a while between a salad or the pita but I've heard how incredibly soft and chewy the pita was and couldn't resist. The pita itself was very fluffy and a great size. Toppings were standard but nothing too overpowering to the lamb which again was salty and fatty and everything you want in gyro. It was a tad on the salty side but otherwise I would order this again 

|| Olive oil yogurt: 3 stars. I think this was a bit of a disappointment and I think it was personal preference. The yogurt itself was great - it's similar to a tart flavored yogurt you'd find at your favorite yogurt place (but better). I wasn't a fan of the olive oil and sea salt. It just didn't work for me on a yogurt, but I would say give it a try. The actual olive oil was golden yellow and of very high quality

I got so full off the bread that I saved my pasta for the next day and tbh it was even better in the morning

"I really like their flavorful and rich broth. I've only been here twice and ordered the tan tan both times and it's delicious! If you're into spicy broth then you must order their volcano sauce on the side (it's extra cost). It's spicy but not overwhelming spicy and it makes the broth texture even more rich and thick. My only minor complaint is their egg yolk isn't runny, and they give you a full size cooked egg. I don't mind a fully cooked egg, but I usually expect something different when it's in my ramen. The noodles are al dente and my soup is basically gone when I'm finished with it. :)

They give you plenty of noodles and I typically give my husband a third of my ramen noodles and I still leave there super bloated and happy. Lol 

If you order a side of their premium pork it would be enough to share with two people. It's a lot! 

We also came on a Tuesday and oddly enough, they were closed. I read other reviews and people say they close randomly, so make sure you call first because we made that mistake before. I hope this helps.",4,2,1,0,1

* JAPCHAE - clear noodles...I love Korean noodles and these had a great flavor and one of my faves so far
* BEEF SHORTRIBS - nicely marinated and yummy
* GYOZA - okay and standard 
* BANCHAN - nice variety...they had kimchi's eggplant which I love! Never had that before!

"Just opened 3 weeks ago!! Fava was created by Chez Panisse alums, so I was really excited to come! Come early, because they're only open from 11-3 and the lamb flatbread is made in limited quantities (50 a day). 

It's a counter service, so plan to take the food to-go or hope to find seating in one of the outdoor chairs. I came at 11:30 on a Saturday and there wasn't much of a line. The lady at the register recommended the lamb flatbread, so that's what I chose to get. She was really friendly and chatted with me while I waited for my order!

The lamb flatbread is a must-get if you come here! It's very hearty; there's a lot of lamb and the flatbread is warm and chewy. There's an orange sauce on it though that makes it drip a lot, so it's a bit of a messy eat. My hands were stained orange for awhile afterward. 
My friend got the beet salad and liked the egg and lentils. She wasn't a huge fan of the beets, but it seems like she doesn't always enjoy them in general.

I came here with my bf and luckily we got the last table, so we didn't had to wait. 
Workers were attentive and nice, the place is small but feels homey. We were looking around to see what everyone ordered, and most orders were soondubu, ( tofu stew) so I ordered a kimchi soondubu and my bf order seafood beef soondubu, both spice level was a mild. 
Before our soup came, they gave us banchan, which is side dishes, there were 8 and they have us a bowl of rice to go with the soup. I do judge korean restaurant by the taste of their kimchi, usually if kimchi is good, the food will be good as well. ( that's just me ) 
Our soup came, and omg it was good, my order had no meat, but I didn't mind that since I LOVE kimchi, and the kimchi was good. Flavor was amazing.

"We ordered about 8 pizzas for a casual work lunch and everyone loved it! Piping hot, generous toppings, creative flavors. Elote flavor for the win! Even plain pepperoni and sausage mushroom were entirely covered in toppings. 

Disclaimer: this is 4.5 stars if you like thick crust Detroit style pizza. It's worth trying even if you're a thin crust aficionado, but no complaints if you don't like thick crust! This is their style and they do it well.

The thick crust was nothing like thick crust from say, Pizza Hut. It wasn't spongy like plain bread, but more a toasty ciabatta. Just the right amount of crisp on the outside, rustic bread on the inside.

Salads were fairly good - I'd say 4/5. All in all delish!

For a quick lunch, with a drink, for under $10, I'm such a happy camper. I can't believe I haven't been going here for my work lunch more often. Also, a Musubi for only $2, that's a steal, and it was also DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken Bowl if you're looking for a lunch-sized portion. I'm not a huge fan of macaroni salad, so the chicken and veggies over steamed rice is perfect. 

I'm surprised to see such a low rating on this place, they really deserve better!",4,2,2,2,1

"Delicious, authentic, fresh! We ate here for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. We came in specifically for the burritos, but we were so inspired by the menu that we had to try the tacos and tamales in addition to the burritos. First, the tamales were yummy. Traditionally prepared with very good masa and flavorful filling (we had chicken). We were so impressed, we picked up more to have for a snack later. Next, we had the carnitas tacos. Fresh tortillas, well cooked meat, and an ample amount of cilantro and onions on top. Lastly, we each had chicken burritos that were so stuffed that none of us could finish ours. 
They do a brisk ""to-go"" or special orders business. We saw large stacks of still steaming tortillas being picked up and meat being wrapped up to go. 
Not much ambiance. There are a few table for in-house diners. The place was very clean. 
A great find and well worth stopping in for a quick bite.",5,0,0,0,1

Staff - A, very attentive, friendly, and patient

"Found this place a while back when I was tired of waiting in long lines at Boiling Crab. I researched the place when they first opened and saw that they started in SoCal. That intrigued me to give it a try since many great places seem to start there. 

The ambiance is very typical as most seafood places, but they are cleaner than most. I like that they have an outside sink before entering into the bathrooms so it is easy for patrons to wash their hands after grubbing. 

We ordered:
- Combo #1: I opted for 2lbs of crawfish and 1lb of shrimp with the Kickin' style seasoning - delicious! Love their seasoning. A little on the sweeter side compared to Boiling Crab, which I prefer. The combo comes with corn, potatoes and sausages. I don't care too much for the corn since it tastes overcooked, the potatoes is just a whole potato boiled in the sauce, and sausage is ok. I prefer to fill myself with other tasty items they serve.
- King Crab legs: not over cooked and fresh.
- Fried Oysters: best friend oysters I have had. Comes with a good sauce as well. 
- Calamari: nicely made
- Fish & Chips: nicely fried fish. The fish is still moist. Not dry like some places. Cajun fries is perfectly fried and nicely seasoned. My daughter loves the fish here, which says a lot since her standards are extremely high.
- Garlic Noodles: we love their garlic noodles better than Boiling Crab. Has a ton of garlicky flavor compared to other places.

"UPDATE: Came here again for team lunch exactly just one week after and over half the menu went up in price. (New menu pic posted to compare prices with previous menu). We were all just raving about its decent pricing so it was pretty disappointing to see that the oyster sampler was $3 more expensive and everything else we ordered from the week before was $1 more. I would understand if this establishment was around for a while, the food was amazing, and after a few years of doing well, prices go up along with retail lease. However, this place opened not too long ago and increasing the pricing so soon just seems a bit slimy and greedy.

"I warily agreed to eat lunch here today when my wife suggested it. I haven't particularly enjoyed eating here the last few times so I must admit that, despited being close to home, Jack's Urban Eats hasn't been top on my list of lunch spots.

I'm going to have to reassess and may frequent the establishment more often, though, as the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich I had today was absolutely delicious. Whereas the chicken was in my opinion too dry last time I was here, the chicken this time was juicy, tender, and delectable. I'm eager to come back and try their Banh Mi again and will probably venture back to try their Ruben and California Cheesesteak.

Perhaps Jack's Urban Eats merely needed to get through the growing pains, or perhaps I was just unlucky the last few trips here... It's worth mentioning that whatever they did, it works... The eatery was packed this lunch, something that most definitely was not the case the last few times I came. Thanks, Jack's Urban Eats! I'll definitely be back.",4,0,2,2,1
"What a great experience! Family owned for over 40 years, Menara Moroccan is a hidden gem. 

We ordered a la carte for four people:
Kebab platter: comes with a skewer each of chicken, lamb, prawns and kefta: nice sampler for everyone to taste a bit of them all. It comes with hot sauce, but get the yogurt sauce on the side too!
Lamb B'stilla. This was our first time trying this after we saw it on a travel cooking show based in Morocco. Sweet and savory wrapped in a flaky phyllo dough. Not to be missed!
Rabbit tagine: served with couscous and veggies. Savory and delicious.
Grilled chicken kebab: we liked the kebab platter so much, we ordered the entree. Yum!
Mint tea and baklava: great ending to the meal. 

The Belly dancing (Thursday to Saturday nights) is both entertaining and interactive!

Service was great. Everyone was very attentive to our needs throughout the meal and when we ordered a drinks, our server even reminded us to check in on Yelp or Facebook so we could get a glass of sangria for free.

CONS: i don't think there was anywhere where the price was listed..? so we would order a lot of things and wouldn't know the price of anything but maybe this is typical of dimsum restaurants, i am not quite sure. and the wait was very long

Ready for a wonderful dinner in an almost 'secret' location? Aziza is the place--romantic, rustic and genius. I think I am in love with Morocco. 

My daddy was visiting from Atlanta with his lady friend and we wanted to take them for some delicious San Francisco dinning. Not that Atlanta does not have its jewels, but this is the Bay Area--we do food right, and Mourad's menu does not disappoint.

We arrived about 20 minutes early for the reservation and thought that was plenty of time to enjoy the fabulous cocktail list at the tiny bar before our table was prepared for us--but we were wrong. They sat us right away, but none to worry, we will enjoy those famous cocktails at the table. I think I might be one of the only people in the world who actually likes to wait for my table at high-end restaurants. 

The venue is small, dark and interesting. The music is as low as the lighting. And the service staff is top tier. 

We were led to our table which was a crescent shaped booth along the wall. It was nice, as we could all sit side by side and look at each other as we talked, shared cocktails and food.

We had a few things to start:
Olives
Beets
Cheeses 

We moved on to:
Couscous
Chicken
Lamb Shank

We shared everything family style; however, I think we drank more cocktails than ate food. My daddy could not understand my Yelp! fetish--the taking of pictures while you eat and asked me not to do such a thing after I snapped photos of the cocktails... 

Stephani frowns for her daddy's request ;(

There is something about Mediterranean food, culture and style that makes my soul smile. I was happy to share this experience with my friends and family--even if I could not offer a pictorial (outside of cocktails) of said visit. This just gives me reason to revisit so I can give a proper pictorial to my fabulous dinner. 

We enjoyed our cocktails, our foods and our conversation. The service was stupendous and the food was even better. What a perfect spot for dinner.

Stephani Smiles for Aziza ;)

First things first: we needed a chicken-stuffed avocado. I think this was a seasonal item, and I'm so thankful I got it into my stomach at the right time. We also shared ceviche, and Peruvian-style ceviche is always my favorite because it's prepared with Leche de Tigre, which is so mouthwateringly citrusy. I love the crunchy cancha too! I wanted some anticuchos (Peruvian skewers), and I wasn't messing around so I got me some grilled beef heart. They were delicious! Juicy meat with a little char, smothered in a tangy peppery sauce.

They have a small menu of 3-4 items, I believe, one of them being veggie! You can get it in a roll or bowl. Getting it in a roll is more fun since you can just get a rice bowl anywhere else! I tried the bulgogi and chicken katsu and they were both really good. The veggies and other things they add into each roll complemented them really well.

Service is great and fast. I love how they bring your roll to you too since I didn't expect it coming from a fast food kind of food place like this. Rori Rice is a great addition to Cupertino! I have another cool place to hit up for lunch now.",5,6,16,10,1

No place in the US can ever compare to the rice noodles I get back home, but this place fills up a hole temporarily and is probably one of the few places I go to for my homesickness. Their homemade chopped chili is amazing though! You can get a small mason jar of it for $7 or $8.",4,0,1,0,1
I stopped in for my first visit to Boiling Point and had a great meal. There wasn't a much of a wait for a weekday lunch. We were seated promptly and given our menus.

I had the Rooster meal. Very tasty sandwich with sharp cheddar, applewood bacon (bacon, another vice), cage free over-easy egg, house pepper jelly. For my side I had the white cheddar mac & cheese. Fantastic meal! This sandwich is Master Chef worthy.

The majority of their menu items are made with 100% all natural chicken thighs - for chicken breast options you have to look for their ""grilled"" items. Meals come with your choice of fountain drink and a side. Oh, btw, they have a nice beer selection too!

I will definitely be back to try the other fried chicken sandwiches such as the club chick grilled and the chicken & waffle sandwich. The other side I want to try is jalape�����o sweet heat coleslaw.

The service was extremely friendly and it was very obvious that they care about their product and their customers' happiness. The day we came in, they were trying out a new cookie. They walked to each table and gave us free samples!!!

"This is a charming place that seems authentic and probably has less than ten tables. Overall, it seems like a fantastic restaurant, though there was a few things lacking in my experience. Let's start with the good stuff:

Spicy pork drunken noodles were amazing and very spicy.
Pad Thai was really good.
Fried quail was to die for. Super crispy yet tender and tasty. 
Chicken skewers were juicy and packed with flavor.
Price is a good few bucks less than other Thai restaurants and the curry comes with rice (I really hate paying 20 bucks for curry and rice because rice costs extra when it's not a lunch special).
Thai iced tea was good, obviously. Might have cost a dollar less than other places, can't remember.
I saw someone get this fried tofu salad and it looked amazing. They said it was good, though I didn't get to try it myself.
They have one TV with sports on if you're interested but it's not intrusive.

The not so good:
Yellow curry wasn't as bomb as the other food. Really stingy with the veggies and not well balanced either. The potatoes were not cooked too well.
The water cups seem like a cool change of pace but they really did not enhance my dining experience. Either the cups or the water itself tasted questionable.
Service is meh.
Portions aren't as large as I'd like but they weren't super tiny.

I would 100% recommend this place. They even had some interesting sounding beers. I will not order yellow curry next time and I'm confident my taste buds are going to be stimulated like never before.",4,0,1,0,1
"I had their green curry for the first time. The flavor was bold, slightly coconutty (?) and had a nice little kick to it. Personally found it to be a little salty over time, so I ate the rest of it with the rice they provided. 
The plate overall had a serving of rice, a side of basic salad, and a bowl to hold the curry. The curry I got was had chicken (can customize the meat) and there was eggplant amongst other veggies in the sauce. (consistency was a little more on the thin side) 

They served a little soup as appetizer, reminded me of a coconut version of miso soup? Tasted ok

They have all the dishes we love!

Our usual order:
- 3 lbs of crawfish with the Shackie's sauce: sauce is amazing. Tastes similar to Kickin Crab, but less sweet more savory. 
- chicken wing sampler with fries: garlic honey flavor is our favorite! We usually opt for sweet potato fries. So good!
- fried fish fillet and fries: my daughter loves it! Perfectly fried fish. Never over cooked as some places do. Their fries are perfectly crisp. Crispy exterior and soft inside.
- garlic noodles: pretty good flavoring. I may prefer Kickin Crab's garlic noodles a little more.
- clam chowder: decent bowl. Not as good as Fish Hopper in Monterey, but decent for a quick fix.

So it's definitely not potatoes, but just as delightful! Maybe it's the cheese but it has this light creaminess that makes it so divine. My second favorite was the roasted corn! It was really yummy. I don't know how else to describe it because I'm a corny kind of girl! Haha. The broccoli was good and had a slight kick to it. Warning it definitely does smell like broccoli and shouldn't be something you eat at your desk because your colleagues will definitely catch a whiff of it! It was pretty good.

If you not into authentic stinky flavors, you won't like this place. The whole place smells, stinky, which is the signature.

I believe there were 11 side dishes and for soondubu, there's a side of rice to go with the soup. You don't necessarily need to eat the rice but trust me, it's the best combo ever ! Also, the soup came out piping hot and also with an egg. Most places the soup they offer isn't really hot, so my egg is never cooked throughly. I'm glad this place has piping hot soup !

"We went to dinner at the Fog House last night and it was wonderful. Food was delicious and service was outstanding. It's located on Pier 39; you will need to walk up a flight of stairs. 

We were seated at a table next to the window and the view was beautiful. We made reservations; I'm not sure if this helped with getting table with a view or not. 

I ordered a cocktail, an Alcatraz Escape and it was comparable to a Mai Tai. It was very tasty. We started with crab cakes as an appetizer and they were delicious. My husband and I both ordered lobster tails. Oh my! These babies were huge! Again, scrumptious. We ended with tiramisu. When my husband suggested it for dessert, I was hesitant since we weren't at an Italian restaurant. No worries, it was wonderful just like the rest of the meal. 

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She provided her personal favorites from the menu. 

This restaurant was on the expensive side but we totally enjoyed our dinner. We also ordered the most expensive item on the menu (lobster tails $51) so you could get by with something not as expensive and I bet it would be equally delicious.

They offer angus rib eye and Kobe beef cuts! I'm more of a fan of lamb, however since they don't have lamb - I always go with the Kobe beef. The marbling on that Kobe is beautiful. They also give you cherry tomatoes and baby corn in your veggie box which is different. 

All broths are very tasty - my top 2 would have to be spicy kimchi and the garlic miso! :)

"Im surprised there are so few reviews for this place. It's very authentic and very popular among the chinese people I know. 

My boyfriend brought me here for dinner after picking me up from the San Jose Airport yesterday. He was recommended this restaurant by our landlord and upon arriving here, he realized he had come here before with coworkers last summer. The restaurant looks nice with bright colors and decorative lights and it was quite busy when we got there around 8pm. There were tables suitable for 2 people, booths for 4, and even big round tables to eat lazy-Susan style. I liked the ambiance of the restaurant the moment we got there. It sits on the corner of a plaza with multiple doors but only one of them on the side is the real entrance. We waited for a few minutes as we browsed the menu. It's nice that the menu has nicely laminated beautiful pictures of the dishes - it helped me and my bf who can't really read chinese and sometimes the english translations of Chinese dishes are hard to picture the dish. 

We ordered 4 dishes that are included in the pictures and two bowls of rice. I noticed that a lot of the dishes had spicy symbols but I didn't think much of it. It was perfect for my boyfriend but a little too spicy for me. I still enjoyed all the dishes and really wishes I had a higher spice tolerance. The crushed eggplants and green peppers was the least spicy dish. The soup with the fish was the most spicy--the soup was but the fish was not. The fish was delicious in texture and taste. The fried lamb chops was good and the fried smoked pork with balloonflower complimented each other very well. We'd never tried balloon flower before and it was pretty good. It's crunchy in texture and reminds me of bamboo shoots. 

The dishes were on the expensive side ~$15+ but the portions are large so we brought home nearly half to 2/3 of what we ordered for our next meal. I really enjoyed this meal and my bf and I would definitely come back many more times as we stay in San Jose!",5,0,0,0,1
"5 stars hands down. 

Came here with my partner and a friend to this 5 star eatery in (North Shore) San Francisco. Wow. 

Dozen (east coast) oysters on the half shell: 5 star
Ice cold briny oysters, perfectly shucked. These oysters come with cocktail sauce (extra horse radish upon request), and they are 5 stars! 

Crab Cioppino: 5 stars. 
Perfectly cooked clam, calamari, mussels, scallops and of course - Dungeness crab! All simmered to perfection in a tomato based cioppino stew with rigatoni. Well seasoned, perfectly spiced (not spicy). More than enough for 2 people. I understand this was the advertised special and I understand why. 

Sartore Amarone wine: 5 stars. 
I know this place has nothing to do with wine making but I'm glad to see they offer a decent wine selection with a wide range price point. 

Service: Rea offered us 5 star service, and even though this place was overly busy on a Monday night, she took the time to check on us and make sure we were taken care of. The check took a bit long to come out, but I'll let it slide.

It's crunchy, spicy, and tasty, especially when enveloped in mayonnaise and mixed with the egg on a cast iron serving platter. I say almost though because sometimes there's too much crunchy stuff and not enough tender pieces to balance out the dish. You need that melt in your mouth goodness too, so your jaw doesn't get tired from chewing! 

I've ordered small trays of their Pork Sisig for parties and it always turns out to be one of the favorites of the party. Both my Filipino and non-Filipino guests always ask me where I got it. They're also happy to take some of it home as there are always too much leftovers from having too much food at a Filipino party:) It's so convenient that I don't have to drive to Union City to get food for my parties. 

On our last visit, we had the Pinakbet, which is a stir-fried medley of veggies (eggplant, okra, green beans, kabocha squash, and bitter melon), with bits of pork and small shrimp, and Bagoong (fermented shrimp). We also had the Garlic Rice which came in a cute little kaldero and Vegetable Lumpia, and that was plenty food with the Sisig order. We ended up taking more than half of the Pinakbet, Sisig and Rice so we had more than enough food for another meal.

We've also had their Lumpiang Shanghai, Kare-Kare, Longsilog and the Bangsilog in the past and they're all pretty solid. The only thing I didn't like is how their Bangus is coated with flour. Not a fan of that. I prefer my bangus just fried plainly. 

Parking in the area is not the greatest. You'll have to park on the side street by the McDonald's. Definitely a good choice for Filipino food in San Leandro!",4,34,49,47,1
"Came here for a special family occasion and loved it! From the very beginning when we stepped in, to the very last minute as we were leaving, we felt like every staff member was trying to make us feel treated like stars. 

Food was excellent too, and I'll list below what we had. But in short, we left very happy and indulged. One star off though because I do think the food menu is overpriced (on the contrary, wine/cocktail menu is awesome and reasonable).

Bites: ($3-3.5/ piece)
- Oysters: super fresh! Get them
- Steak tartare: meh, was OK. Wish I had gotten deviled eggs instead

Starters: ($10-15)
- soup of the day: delicious and generous portion
- Portobello fritters: amazing!! Get them. The aioli on the side was the perfect match

Entrees:
- Lobster risotto ($26): my sister loved it and could not finish. Great filling portions and decadent
- Filet mignon ($38): steak was could perfectly medium rare and so juicy. Def worth it
- Rack of lamb ($38): meaty and cooked very well. Seasoned well too. Loved the farro salad on the side
- striped bass ($36): my dad said was OK. Would skip. Also too small in portion 

Had the sundae for dessert ($10) - DELICIOUS, definitely get this.

+ 3 glasses of wine (average $12 per glass) and +2 beers (average $6). Wine and beer and cocktails all priced very reasonably! 

For family of 5, came out to $400 including tax + tip",4,0,0,1,1

"First time here and there were 5 of us. We came on a Sunday for lunch and we came right on time. As soon as we started ordering, people are coming in non-stop then after awhile, there is already a long line for waiting. It looks like a 50-seater restaurant so it's pretty small. However, it looks pretty decent, clean and food is great. What impressed me the most is their customer service! Servers are very nice and polite. As soon as you enter, you are greeted with smiles and energy. Water and green tea is filled up constantly every so often. Then fast service as well. The restroom, which is also a major factor for me when I go to a restaurant, is pretty organized and sanitary. When the restroom is polished, that means the management's policy and mission on keeping their place and food clean and pristine is on par and is a standard. Very, very important. Price is reasonable. And we even got 5 free green tea ice cream. We noticed thay give it away at every table after paying. That's a really nice gesture for a restaurant since they opened one year ago already. I would understand if it's only a month!
Then, we got free order of gyoza (5 pcs). On top of that, they give free edamame on every table. So I'm giving them 5 stars Highly recommended!",5,0,3,2,1
"We ordered the following:

Ceviche Trio with Taro chips - The ceviche was a little too sour for me, but the seafood was super fresh, and I loved the Peruvian corn in the ceviche.

Paella - This was good, but needed more Saffron. It's a lot tastier than Paellas I've had at other restaurants. I've had homemade Paella, so I hold Paella to great standards when ordering at a restaurant. 

Rotisserie chicken - This was tender and had good flavor, better than Costco's. (By comparing it to Costco, I don't mean that in a bad way). The sweet potato fries were also good.

Lomo Saltado - This was my first time having it, and I thought it was interesting. My friends liked it. It was like a beef tenderloin stir fry on top of fries with a side of rice. Apparently it's a Peruvian favorite. The flavor was decent, but I was unsure about the fries and rice together in one dish.

4/5 on the 1 lb of shrimp, mild, combo flavor. 

4/5 the calamari was good but it didn't look cooked all the way. 

Service was slow but they were really friendly. They messed up our order on the shrimp but gave us our added potatoes eventually. Ambience is really chill but it can get very loud with people watching sports there. Overall had a good time here and food does the job.",4,0,2,2,1

The service was very attentive both at the bar as well as at the table. While I was having a drink at the bar before the table, the bartender offered some of their breads. The walnut bread was a treat. If you find yourself in Oakland, be sure to check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",5,0,0,0,1
I was genuinely shocked at how good the chicken is here. All my family ever really had for fried chicken is Popeyes and KFC. The fried chicken is not greasy at all and it makes you want to come back for more. We had the Yangnyeom chicken (Spicy) and the original Crispy Fried Chicken(Mild). This is such a great combo if you haven't had Korean Fried Chicken before. I do have to warn you the spicy chicken is quite spicy but if you get Yangnyeom to get spicy and not the mild it tastes way better. It has only been a couple of weeks and I've already came back to this place twice. Looking forward to coming back again!,5,0,0,0,1
"I keep saying I want popcorn chicken but never get it. It's been at least 3 months, and I finally got some! Sophie N. and I had a little catch up over snacks and boba. Where oh where is there popcorn chicken in Sunnyvale? Tea Era in Cupertino gives a generous amount but drinks disappoint. Searched on Yelp and found Chick & Tea! I once visited the Milpitas location and found the g pie sweet. The great thing about C&T is all the food, albeit fried food. Snacks, meals with rice, drinks, modern laidback atmosphere. Definite like.

*Popcorn chicken- good portion with some basil and I like the small cut pieces!
*Fried tofu was juicy! Hot off the fryer and smooth/firm inside.
*Fried taro balls were *AMAZE balls according to Sophie (my choice of words haha) It was love at first bite for her. Light taro flavor with a bit of crumbly egg yolk in the center?
*Taiwanese tempura (Fish) was shaped like fries, but were mochi soft and chewy.
*Black sugar milk tea with lychee jelly was pretty good! I'd get it again.
*Taro milk tea with fresh taro chunks, artificial purple taro threw us off. Best thing about it was the real taro at the bottom. 

Omg I keep wanting to say Japanese tempura!
TJ? helped me out with ordering. He was super patient and had a fun demeanor. I asked about crystal boba and they were out, same with grass jelly. He offered lychee jelly instead, which complimented the black sugar MT. I wanted fried calamari but they only have the whole squid. I opted for the suggested tempura. TJ was so nice; he even delivered our order straight to our table. Had a bit of a delay with the Taiwanese tempura, but I asked later on and staff brought it over ASAP.

"I've been meaning to write a review for this place for so long and right when I'm about to, I see someone petty write a very nasty review below me. How sad that people stoop to a low level just because they're impatient. The staff is actually really friendly here and take a lot of ""Sugar Honey Iced Tea"" from people, if you catch my drift. Let me answer some mistakes the reviews give you just so they can get a reaction from readers on yelp. 

First of all, this isn't the only location so you can drive to their sister on Curtner if the line is too long or if food isn't being made as quick as you personally probably want it to be made. It happens sometimes when a business runs out of food faster than they can make it and it's really not their fault. The demand is high but that's a good thing for their business, it means people want to order their food until there's none left. 

Secondly, the business isn't all ""young people"" or however people assume and label young to everyone as is. You know the legal hiring age for businesses is 18 so they're all legally adults and not ""kids"" who've put in their effort to have an opportunity to get hired and work for such a popular seafood business in the Bay Area. I'm sorry if the older generations, typically the 20+ range want to be disgusted by a much more active generation of workers who are doing their best to make ends meet.

Lastly, the food is still great! I'm sure that's what everyone was waiting to read about. They portion their food as best as they can for their customers and some people are greedy and want more than they're already getting. I can't even finish a bowl sometimes because of how filling it makes me. It's so good here and I absolutely cannot stress than enough. Yes, it's on the pricy side but seafood itself is expensive and their giving you the best quality of food, but to others who may not know, just like groceries and other businesses, politics is playing its role in being able to acquire the necessary game and produce food service needs in order to feed their customers. You just have to come here and try it out for yourself to enjoy everything they offer. They're working hard to feed you people and that's all that should really matter! 

Report my review if it sounds like a clap back but it's only offensive if it's true. Just had to be honest about a business I truly care about and receive good food from.",5,0,1,2,1

"If you have to get one thing here, it's the basil fried rice. I've been coming here for 10 years and it still tastes just as amazing. I have not found another thai restaurant that makes a better basil fried rice. I usually get mild spiciness and it's already pretty spicy for me. You get a ton of chicken strips, basil, red peppers, and a fried egg on top. It's just heavenly fried rice. SO GOOD!
Some other sides that we usually order are:
Basil Chicken Traditional Thai: ground chicken with a crazy SPICY kick; this goes so well with rice
Any of the curries: just depends on what you're feeling like. Green curry has eggplant so that's always a plus. Red and yellow are sweeter than green.
Tamarind Fish: Sweet and sour fish, basically. Huge pieces of fish that are not over-battered.

TBH, I don't think you would dislike any of the sides here. The prices are a little high but this is still my favorite place to get Thai food.",5,1,3,1,1

I liked the ambiance too, it's a very pretty small restaurant, with beautiful tables and chairs.

After spending six months going to school in Seoul I developed a craving for everyday Korean cuisine, no fancy or fusion style, which can be a challenge to find. I ordered my college staple, the dolset bibimbap with bulgogi, and it came out of the kitchen legitimately sizzling at the temperature it should be. They were very generous with the sauces as well as the banchan (side dishes). However the crowning jewel of the evening was their green onion and seafood pancake.

"This review is for the weekend brunch. 

In Cupertino, this is my go to spot for Sunday brunch based on the food, service, convenience and most importantly, the chance to play some corn hole. 

On two recent visits, we had the following, which are all recommended 
- Loco moco
- Fried Chicken and waffles (note, this dish comes with deep fried chicken pieces rather than drumsticks, wings and so on that's been left on the bone prior to hitting the deep fryer) 
- Crullers, amazing and perfect for the sweet tooth hound 

TIPS
- Based on server Danielle's recc, I can't wait to try the Mac n Cheese, with an added sausage on top! 
- Grab a table in the back next to the Living Wall, which is a verdant literal wall of eco life
- Play some corn hole, outside on the patio",5,4,4,5,1
"Metered street parking in front of this location. Thankfully it's summer and I found parking with ease. 

Once inside, you see the cashier. I mistakingly started ordering there first, but you actually head to the right and start placing your order there. It seems a little counterintuitive since the glass screen between you and the food are so high, but I appreciate that it makes things more sanitary. 

You order your base, your protein, toppings, and then your sauce. 

I loved eating here because I rarely eat fresh veggies but this place makes it so easy to have something super tasty with no problem!

"Cheeseburger craving was real today! After walking away from my visit to the post office, there it was. Got my craving taken care of.

This place hit the spot. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a side of fries. I instantly regretted not getting curly fries until my food was ready and i ate a fry. Yeah...they were good. Crispy and oil soaked from the fryer. Naughty naughty, yummy yummy.

The burger was also tasty. Cooked a little more medium than medium rare but I wasn't complaining! 

The slice of cheese was thin so if you're looking for that cheesy cheeseburger taste - ask for an extra slice. I wasn't a fan of the bun, but other reviewers enjoy it so don't take my word on it. Thought the top was a little dry unless I saturated it with condiments or smashed it into the beef patty. I refrained. Speaking of condiments...they have a condiments bar so you can top it as you wish. For me that meant all the pickles and jalape�����os!

"June 4, 2019

If first impressions are everything, ""Los Pericos Grill"" left a great one on me. First of all I'm all about ambiance and great service. I'm all about a clean establishment and most of all, great food. The best part about me finding out about this establishment was it wasn't through ""Yelp"" it was on ""Instagram"" when they messaged me and just simply said ""Come visit us, you'll like it guaranteed!"" Very bold, I like when a business knows how to market themselves and grab attention, now that made me seek them out and now I'm here, here is what I thought about them..

Los Pericos Grilled:
This establishment sits in an area of Hayward that seems to get a lot of foot traffic. Being a corner business I feel makes them stand out. No lie, Hayward and the Bay Area in general has a lot of Mexican/El Salvadorian eateries and such, so it's really hard to stand out. ""Los Pericos Grilled"" does a great job of holding their own and on my visit, provided me with something to write about. ""Carne Asada Fries"" anyone? Let me tell you about them..

Carne Asada Fries $10.29 - On their ""IG"" these are what caught my eye. Like the whole concept of ""Carne Asada Fries"" are ""Steak and Potatoes"" like how could you go wrong with meat and carbs? Well the answer to that is ""You Can't"" and these were ""all that"" (not the show) and a complimentary bowl of chips get it? A very healthy portion of fries topped with chopped carne asada, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. I skipped the pico which they normally arrange in the colors of the ""Mexican Flag"" but I like my pico on the side. This dish was hearty, and it was honestly enough for two people to share and get full off of. The best I've honestly had for awhile, while this dish isn't the most true example of ""Mexican Food"" this restaurant definitely makes ""Carne Asada Fries"" worth talking about as I wasn't the only one in the restaurant who ordered them. 

Soda $2.50 - They had your run of the mill usuals, sodas and juices. But what I went after was the ""Agua Frescas"" I like that they offered the variety they did (horchata, tamarind, pi�����a and hibiscus) and all of them tasted really fresh and not made with a flavored powder. Think of these type of ""Latin - Ade"". These were the bomb and the 20oz cup allowed me to get as many refills as I can handle. I was satisfied from food to drink.

Overall:
Along with the great service and clean restaurant, I would recommend this place to everyone. A very good establishment that makes me excited to come back and visit and try more offerings. They're the real deal here.",5,19,25,22,1
"OH MY GOODNESS. Where have I been all this time?!
Maybe I came on a good day? But I don't know what other people are complaining about and I've had my fair share of Cantonese cuisine - I'm from SoCal for heaven's sake. 

First of all, we had the Peking Duck - I appreciated that it wasn't humongous and perfect for two people who were devouring 5 other dim sum dishes. 

Pork Buns - my boyfriend is a big fan of pork buns and now I know why. I'm probably spoiled now because this was legit! The buns were fluffy and pork wasn't too sweet. Nothing about these buns was dry or flaky.

Pork potstickers - definitely no lack of meat here. OMG so juicy and plump. Seasoning was perfect, too!

Crispy shrimp puffs - BEST EVER! Shrimp was not bland and seemed fresh!

Sticky rice - loved this, too! Good portions and not salty. 

Shrimp and chive dumplings - this was probably my favorite. The dumpling skin was clear and a taaaaaaaad bit undercooked but it didn't bother me. 

We will definitely be back!",5,0,1,0,1
"Best oysters of my life? Overlooking the water? As the sun set on Alcatraz, the bridge and the bobbing sailboats? FINE I'LL TAKE IT.

Fog Harbor's menu is plenty big and features all the traditionally prepared seafood you could ask for. The dirty martini and scallop/crab risotto were also delicious, but in hindsight I should have just planned to eat my weight in raw oysters. Ah well - next time! Also, my server was a delight. She agreed with me about the oysters and was very friendly and attentive.

Minus one star for the ambience: the location, view and quality of Fog Harbor make it a huge draw for tourists, and it appears the restaurant tries to stuff as many bodies as possible into the restaurant. I had a table in the middle of the dining room, and felt very cramped next to my fellow diners and sightly in the servers' way at all times. I felt the pinch as soon as I arrived - the situation around the host stand was crowded and chaotic and different hosts gave me contradictory guidance. It was a stressful situation to navigate with a carry-on suitcase in tow (my own damn fault, sure. Next destination: airport). Was really hoping they might have a coat room to stow the bag!

"Lim������n Rotisserie has been on our radar for some time and we finally got to try their Walnut Creek location. We came for the the chicken, but it was the beef that got our attention.

We ordered the Pollo a la Brasa (rotisserie chicken) with Chifa Green Beans and Yuca Fries, Lomo Saltado (stir-fried beef tenderloin), and the Pulpo a la Parrilla (grilled octopus). The half chicken that we had was delicious. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The Aji Amarillo Huacatay sauce thst came with it was remarkable as well. The octopus looked awesome, but was very salty. It was served over a very buttery mashed potato. The beef was absolutely amazing although a little bit skimpy and the rice that came with it was undercooked.

There were a couple of items on the menu that we wanted to try - the Camarones al Ajo (saut�����ed shrimp in garlic) and the Lengua a la Parrilla (grilled beef tongue) - but we didn't want to order more than we can finish. Maybe next time we",4,1,2,3,1
"Chef Aki is a sushi master in East Bay. Since moving to Berkeley a few years ago, I've been pretty saddened by the lack of quality-focused sushi restaurants in the East Bay. I've tried a hand full in Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley. While there are some that are pretty good Japanese restaurants, like Kiraku and Ippuku, none of them specialize in classic Edo-style sushi like the restaurants in San Francisco. Until I discovered Sushi Sho, my husband and I have always driven across the Bay Bridge to our usual favorites in SF like Hinata, Zushi Puzzle, Omakase, Kusakabe etc...

My first time at Sushi Sho was during my birthday this year, and it was amazing! The restaurant's sushi bar is intimate, romantic, and provides a personalized eating experience with Chef Aki. They offer just a few seatings each day, which need to be reserved in advance. Weekdays are easier than weekends, of course. Several tiers of omakase's are offered, as well as a la carte selection. I opted for the 16 piece omakase for $80pp, and ordered some additional items to share:

- Ankimo (monk fish liver. very good here, but still not as good as my favorite at Zushi Puzzle)
- Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard, loaded with wonderful seafood surprises at the bottom!)
- Akadashi (special miso soup with yellowtail and tri-foil
- Bateira sushi (Speciality vinegar-pressed sushi, which are specialities of Chef Aki. We ordered both the ""saba/mackrel"" and ""cold-smoked salmon"" Both were phenomenal and SO unique!)

The omakase was divine. Everything was delicious, seasonal, perfectly seasoned and marinated. It brought me back to all the omakase's I had in Japan. Chef Aki is an incredibly warm and friendly host. Although we were seasoned omakase-eaters, he took his time to explain the preparation, fish and method of eating to our fellow diners who have not had sushi like this. He was non-judging and incredibly talented. I am incredibly happy that such a wonderful sushi establishment is so close to where I live. The price for the omakase is also a great value as most omakase restaurants in SF start at around $125 minimum, for less fish. We were able to taste several fish, shipped fresh from Japan, including Hokkaido uni when Chef Aki heard I loved uni. 

Overall, my lovely experience that leaves me craving for me. Hopefully this review doesn't make it harder for me to get a reservation in the near future!",5,0,3,2,1
This place is authentic and delicious. We always try to come on a Sunday afternoon but it's usually a 1 hour + time wait... They serve dim sum during that time and their dinner is usually a more extensive menu. We come here often to celebrate birthdays and get their salted egg fried rice and a few other seafood dishes. Definitely a must try!,5,0,0,0,1

"The gunmandu (fried dumpling) is amazing! It's incredibly flavorful and has a nice crisp factor. You have the choice to order a half or full plate. 

The jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodle) was great. The noodle has a very nice texture and the sauce has the perfect flavor. 

The bokkeummyeon (stir-fried noodle w/ shrimp and veggies) was delicious. I ordered it mild and it was actually hotter than expected. Their spice level is definitely a different range from other restaurants but it tasted amazing. 

The restaurant itself is clean, spacious, and nice. The servers were nice and fast. I would definitely return.",4,0,0,0,1
"Came here with my wife. The ambience is nice. First the food. The garlic bread was amazing! Probably the best I've had in years. Really enjoyed it, the portion was a little on the small side. The Lasagna was good. Not the best I've had but definitely better than most I have had. One of the few places that serves beef only lasagna so I did like that. My wife had the ravioli and really enjoyed it. We had a very good dinner. One thing kept me from giving this place five stars...there was a manager that seemed to be yelling at her employees in front of customers. 1) This is not cool, to belittle your employees in front of an audience of guests. 2) This ruins employee morale. You should never have to run a business with fear. It should be run via admiration and respect for its management, and that can only be gained by trust and working hard at building relationships. Yelling at employees in front of customers presents a bad impression of the business.
That being said the food and ambiance is very good here. We'll definitely give come back.",4,0,1,1,1

"Ate here on a Thursday evening and was surprised that the only customers that came by were only picking up and not dining in, so service was quite prompt and friendly.

Banchan (side dishes) were very fresh and tasty. We didn't leave anything leftover :)

We had the cheese corn, seafood soondooboo (tofu stew, quite creamy and not too salty, goes very well with rice that it came with), and the seafood pajeon (pancake). It wasn't a heavy meal but we left very satisfied, and brought a little bit of the leftover seafood pancake home.

Pretty decent price considering it's San Francisco. Will come again to try other dishes :)",5,1,1,1,1
"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was our first time trying Omakase type of dining. Our chef (Chef Kevin Lo) very entertaining to watch and listen to. He knew definitely knew his stuff. He's also one of the faster chefs!

"Love this place! My family, friends, and I have been coming here since they opened! We've even had one of my birthdays here!

I'm mostly glad they opened this location (their 3rd one) because the 1st and 2nd location are really far.

I always get the pork tocino with Java rice. When my whole family and I come here, we get pork tocino, sisig, longanisa, miswa, and bbq. 

The price is fair for how much they give! The service is good as well; unless it's really busy, then it starts to slow down a bit. 

But overall, I love coming here and I'll always come back as long as the quality and quantity of the food stays the same!",5,1,1,2,1
"The Oxford is a fusion of mainly British Indian dishes. When I came for lunch about a year ago, there was plenty of vegetarian options and even they had a vegetarian pot pie that was absolutely delicious! When I came for dinner today, the menu was completely changed and instead they had few vegetarian options. One of the options was some sort of ravioli dish which to me feels wrong to have when your dining at an Indian Restaurant. 

I decided to order a indian eggplant dish and my friend ordered the falafel sliders. I have to say service was slow. When we initially got seated, our server didn't come until 15 minutes later. When we put in our order, the food took awhile to get, and lastly just to get a check, it took some time. I wish our server was more attentive so minus 1 star for that. 

The food was absolutely delicious and it was good portion sizes that were super filling. The eggplant dish I had was basically grilled eggplant on a bed of saffron rice with a yellow curry sauce that had cashew nuts in it. It was beautifully plated and really flavorful. My friend liked his sliders as well.

Overall, a solid spot in downtown Sunnyvale to eat at!",4,2,3,5,1
"THE RUMORS ARE TRUE!! Claw Shack is the best spot around for cajun food in a trash bag!!! I'm so mad at myself for taking so long to give this place a try.

Came here Saturday around 6pm and had to wait about 30 mins. The wait wasn't bad at all. As soon as we were seated we ordered right away. The food took LESS than 10 minutes to come out! The crawfish wasn't the biggest, most juiciest ones I've had, but the sauce flavor was the best I've ever had! I'm salivating as I write this... I got the spiciest spice level and it was super spicy, but not as spicy as the spiciest at Crawdaddy. Really enjoyed it, though. 

Also got the cajun fries which were thing and perfectly crispy. The garlic noodles were so delicious and not as drenched in butter like the other cajun places. I'd highly recommend both.

Service was forgettable, but everything went by so quick so all is good. 10/10 would recommend. Definitely my new favorite next to Crawdaddy :)",5,1,4,6,1
"Decided to channel my inner lazy dog by swinging by here for a round of drinks on a Thursday evening and am quite impressed by it.

Location: Conveniently located in a compound right opposite orange theory. Parking was VERY hard to find. Got the farthest spot in the parking lot so be prepared for that (or just Uber it up)

Apps: We had the truffle fries, chicken wings and some other finger food. All tasted good as expected.

Mains: The salmon was a bit dry and so was the pasta. However, everything had good portion sizes to share. My boyfriend wanted a fruit as a side with his cheeseburger (he's a little weird) and it was hilarious how they cut up an eight of a watermelon and put it on the side.

Drinks: all the cocktails were good! I had the Moscow mule and sangria flight and enjoyed them all.

Service: Now this was a bit of a letdown. No one checked on us for a 40 minutes after our first round. I kept waving some staff down but I don't think anyone saw me. Finally we got hold of someone but were a bit tired to order another round by then. Everyone was pleasant but they were very short handed!",4,1,0,1,1
"This is a very nice place. It's new, small with good interiors. Can come here to hangout with Friends or on a date. 
I ordered the vegetarian soup that I liked a lot. It's different from usual soups served at other places. The only thing I would do to improvise the soup would be to reduce some turmeric and add some more red chilli powder. 
The Taj Mahal beer was liked a lot by my friends. The thaali with Malai kofta was great too. 

Definitely worth the money.",5,0,1,4,1

"This is such a cute place! Came here for brunch with four friends on a Sunday morning. Made reservations easily online through Yelp via Open Table. We went a little later, 1PM and they were still pretty busy. They have a cute interior, but it was a little confusing. Half of the people were there watching the football games, with jerseys on. The other half were just brunching. They'd turn on music for a little bit, which was a totally cool vibe. But then randomly, they'd switch to the football game and that would be blasting in the background. It really didn't have that sports bar feel to me, but whatever. It wasn't a huge deal, but just an observation while there. Seems like they're still trying to figure out what kinda spot they are, at least on the weekends. 

Aside from that, the food and drinks are really good! Since we did go for brunch, they had both their breakfast and lunch menus available. They had chicken and waffles, which is one of my brunch go-to's. I decided on that, but I could have easily eaten a hamburger later on, lol. It was good, definitely no complaints except the portion seemed a tad light. Maybe I was starving and should have ordered an appetizer too, who knows. Everyone else in our party enjoyed their food as well. 

After we were done with brunch, we made our way outside. This patio is so cute and I definitely recommend trying to get a spot out here on a nice day! We played a round of corn hole and jenga, while hanging out and ordering more drinks. They have an upstairs area as well with a bar. They have great spots to take pictures for the gram, which we definitely did! Overall, this was a great place to brunch. I would come back here again, when in the area.",4,7,8,7,1
"I. LOVE. SCOMA'S.

Hidden a bit out of the way (all the better, I selfishly don't ever want to have to wait in a line to be able to eat here) near Fisherman's Wharf, Scoma's serves up possibly the best clam chowder I've ever had in my life.

Aside from that, the fritto misto is amazing - anchovies are fried perfectly! The fried seafood platter was also divine, as it's only lightly battered so the fried exterior doesn't take ANY of the flavor away, and you're able to bite down into a massive chunk of fresh scallops and taste everything that is good in the world. The calamari sauce is incredible, as is the polenta that comes with it.

The service is great - they can sometimes be a bit slow, but you can tell they take a lot of pride in what they do and the food they serve, which is so great to see.

Go-to.",5,1,3,1,1

Had the #3 lunch which comes with Salad, 1/2 Gyro Wrap, 1/2 Chicken Kebab, and dipping sauce. Each table also receives complimentary pita bread, hummus, and an olive tapenade. Healthy food in this sit-down restaurant. Approximately 90 minutes for lunch, a bit longer than a typical lunch resulting from taking the time to munch on the pita with hummus and olive tapenade.

"To Pagal C.

Since I can't reply to you specifically, I am deciding to let the public know and to set the record straight. The night you came in the restuarant, you tell the server, there was three of you and they seated you. Normally, if there's a party and not all patrons are present, they won't seat you until you are all here. I'm the one who gave you the menu, and you said immediately that you're ready to order, which would be impossible since I was occupied with another table that came before you. Because the other table came first, I had to serve them first. From what you wrote, you paid attention to the other customers without knowing their situation and assume from your perspective. The lady who was serving you, jotted down the soup order so that the soup would be an appetizer and would come back to write down the rest of your order. Rudely, you asked if you should leave, which made no sense and had no point. Not only this review, you returned back to the restaurant and stopped by to complain again to the same lady about the service the previous night. Are you trying to hurt the business, or trying to get her fired, I'm curious on your intent.",5,0,0,0,1

Black Rice was good, not too sweet and the texture was perfect. Coconut Redbean pudding did not have enough redbean, if only they add bit more redbean, it would be perfect.

"Great place for a nice dinner! I took my mother here for her birthday dinner and made reservations on a Friday night @ 7:30pm. We were running 15 minutes late, so I called ahead to notify the restaurant, and they seemed to be grateful for the heads up. Upon arrival, our table was not ready, and we had to wait an additional 15 minutes before being seated, so not terrible, but being seated promptly at time of arrival would have been nice. Nick took the time to apologize for the wait, so that was much appreciated. 

I ordered the wild mushroom soup and parmesan herb crusted veal chop with fried baby kale and sun-dried tomato garlic cream. They were able to accommodate my request to substitute the butter beans with more kale. Our food came out quickly and my main entree was extremely well executed. The kale was nice and crispy, and the veal chop was tender and had a good sear. The tanginess of the sun-dried tomato sauce paired well with the dish overall. 

However, I thought the wild mushroom soup needed a little more salt, and it was not as creamy/rich as I would have liked, but that's just my personal preference.

For dessert, our waiter brought us a complimentary espresso cheesecake, since I mentioned it was my mom's birthday, so that was really nice!

As a final note, the prices are very reasonable considering the large portions and quality of the food being served. I will come back, especially for special occasions!",4,1,3,1,1
"Tried their AYCE for lunch. I personally love the ratio for their sushi. It's not too much rice and are in small portions so it's not too overwhelming to eat. 

Some suggestions I would say since they are newly opened is that they should try laminating their menu so it'a easier for customers to just erase and re-use the menu instead of bothering them for a brand new piece of paper every time they need to order again. The staff were super patient and friendly despite the fact we did bothering them multiple times for paper and constant tea refills.

We got a caraff of sangria which was amazing. Good sangria. 

We also got the tartufo crostini. It was savory. It was sweet. It was hearty. Best appetizer ever! The goat cheese with the honey on top of bread was PERFECTION!! The drizzle of oil was just enough too. I wish I could eat this every day! 

Lastly, we got the award winning margherita pizza. Now we already know this pizza is going to be great. It's won some fancy award right? What I was not expecting was the sauce! Blown. Away.

Location: it's located in the same plaza as sprouts. They have ample parking. And the lot isn't too busy.

They take credit cards. Have plenty of options. And they are known for their calamari (but they ran out when we were there so we couldn't try it :/)

"Looking for a quick but good dinner on Sunday night we came across this place.

WAIT: There was 1 person in front of us but the inside was pretty bustling. I think we were a bit early since it was barely 6pm. Some people were getting to go and some were eating inside and outside so if you come at a good time it shouldn't be too bad.

ATMOSPHERE: Very vibrant inside with murals and things on the walls, people wrote things on another wall and these little signs that give you some courtesies (50 minute table limit, don't drink more than 3 cups of the chai) etc. It's a bit loud from the talking and the kitchen but I thought it was lively. The inside is pretty small with probably only 7 or so tables. You can also sit outside if the weather is good enough, which can seat more.

FOOD: You order at the front then get a table number and then sit down.

CHICKEN TIKKA PLATE - I forget the exact name but it's the area with kebabs and other dishes that come with some sides, rice and you can add half naan (2 pieces) for about $0.85 or you can get full naan for $1 something. It's a good amount of food for $10+. You get a little dish of chicken tikka masala, a scoop of basmati rice, lenti/daal, some salad and cucumber side. For 1 person it's plenty. One thing to note is that the chicken tikka is spicy! I can't handle spicy so I was dying and had to drink lots of water and eat rice. The flavor though was very good and the chicken tender and not dry at all (I think they use dark meat). I really enjoyed it. My only gripe is that the naan wasn't what I was used to. It wasn't a bit flaky and chewy or thick, it was kind of like a pita bread or a tortilla. Very flat and more bread-y than other naan I've had.

My husband got some of the chai (it's free) and he said it was really good.

Overall, I would definitely be back because of the quality of the food and the price.",4,5,6,7,1
"Vietnamese place that goes all out on their menu selection.

This place is huge, a lot of tables, and they also have a lot of parking. They also have a huge menu that takes some time to sift through.

The first time I came, I had to wait 5-10 mins for my friend to come and my waiter joked if they were even coming. I didn't really appreciate it, and thought it was unnecessary.

I do like that they give complementary shrimp chips each time though, it's unique and a good appetizer.

That time I got the pho, and it was pretty ordinary, good basic pho. The noodles were a little hard though, but otherwise was tasty.

The second time I went, I got goi cuon nem nuong, which I was pretty excited for since I do love this particular spring roll style (similar to Brodard in Garden Grove). Also got the fish sauce chicken wings, also one of my favorites.

Both of these dishes did not disappoint. The chicken wings were soo good- hot, crispy, and flavorful. The spring rolls were pretty good too. Their spring roll sauces were a little sweet- but a nice complement.

In general would say the prices here are a little high but normalish for bay area, haha, unfortunately. The menu is huge so I would love to come back and try other stuff- its the only place I have ever seen where they have so many different variations of bun bo hue... and spring rolls (including avocado?).... and drink selection.

Try it out!",4,0,0,0,1
"What a great find! Not just spam and rice, they have a ton of musubi options, from the standard to vegetarian (possibly vegan?), with lots of interesting combinations in between. We just happened to walk by today and caught sight of their signage, came in and were greeted by a friendly cashier who let us know it was their second day open. Nice clean, bright, and inviting space, with seating inside and out. Looks like they're planning on doing a lot of order-online stuff, with rows and rows of the pink take-away boxes lined up and ready, as well as a pasty-shop style glass case where you could eye the options. 

Perhaps more importantly, the musubi is excellent! I snagged a spam+egg and California roll, both were delicious. The rice is just right, not too firm, and they didn't over sauce. Excited to go back again soon to try out more, they're excellent little grab-and-go and would make a fun work treat as well. 

I really hope they survive! Nice people, clean shop, and good food!",5,0,8,3,1
"We've seen this place many times while visiting the City Center. It is often packed around lunchtime. We were in the area and decided to give it a try - glad we did!

Their Banh Mi is just great. It is stacked high, but just enough. The pork is tender and tasty, and doesn't overpower the veggies or drown them out. Sure, I've had better, but Mendocino Farm's Banh Mi feels refined and tasty. The ""A Sandwich Study of Heat"" was also delicious. Their cheese replacement is good. They only have one kind: ciao. It melted well - a good sign. The only things amiss were that the sandwiches were stacked pretty high and fell apart. However, since they were so delicious it didn't really matter! Next time we may opt for salads as the bread can be tough on sensitive gums.",5,1,1,1,1

"This place is AMAZING. Absolute #1 best part is the superb service. Nora and June are magical. They make you laugh and give great suggestions. Enter as strangers, leave as friends and return as family. If you are the type of person that doesn't like to interact with the employees, then don't come here, because they are attentive and caring. 

Now about the food... it is THE BOMB. Family is obsessed with the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken, Spicy Basil Ribeye, I'm in love with the Pra-Ram Peanut Sauce chicken. The potstickers are honestly the best I have ever had, the dipping sauce is sticky sweet and you can taste the fresh herbs and spices. Crispy spring rolls are delicious. We tried the Papaya Salad tonight and it was SO refreshing and crisp. The lettuce and was extra crunchy and fresh and the dressing was soooo good. The plating and presentation of the dishes look pretty too, Instagram worthy. Thai iced tea was creamy and magical. Beer was cold and Wine was crisp.

The decor in the restaurant is very nice as well. If you get a chance to sit in the booths on the right against the far back wall, you can see all the little mini decorations they have behind glass. SO CUTE. The chandeliers/lamps are beautiful, too. Overall restaurant was very clean, no sticky menus or tables, silverware and glasses were immaculate. 

Another plus is that the prices are pretty dang fair here, and portions are huge. I'm a big girl and I didn't even finish half my entree... now I get to take leftovers for lunch tomorrow, yay!!! 

Overall, I highly highly highly recommend this place to all. They have options for every diet and palate. I know restaurants in this shopping center of San Ramon are notorious for going out of business, so I really hope that this place is here to stay. Family and I are trying to make Thai Taste a once-a-week (at least) habit for dinner. So good! We love you Nora and June, thanks for making it the best experience possible. I'm excited for my leftovers lol.",5,0,2,0,1
"First of all, use the Yelp waitlist! You're welcome. 

Braised beef is one of my favorite foods. It's meaty, rich, and savory. Between two people, we ordered one item and it was enough. We got the braised beef rib with oxtail. The portion size is ridiculous! It can feed probably 4-6 adults. You order it with the host before you sit down, and it comes out pretty quick. We got ours topped with cheese, and there is a little bit of a show when they bring it out and torch it right in front of you.

The texture of the meat is definitely tender, but still has a little bit of a bite. It doesn't fall apart and turn to mush. Just the way I like it. Level 2 spicy is perfect. Enough heat to know it's there, but still taste the flavors of the sauce. While it doesn't come with the most banchan compared to other Korean restaurants, they're made well and seem high quality. 

The seating is a little weird. It's communal dining. My friend and I were sat in the middle of a long table, across from each other, in-between two other parties. 

I've never had Kalbijjim before, and most of my experiences with Korean food is usually BBQ. It's nice to try something different. After having my fill of braised beef, and a bottle of yogurt soju, our pot looked like we had barely made a dent. It's kind of sad. We had to take most of it home. I've never been to a restaurant and only ordered a single item. I usually love to order tons of appetizers or tapas to try a lot of flavors, but overall it was an awesome experience!",4,0,1,1,1
"Black Garlic Oil Ramen. We order it every time. It's the best. LOVE IT. Haven't had anything else on the menu...ok, a can of Coke.

"In A Nutshell:

-Gooyi Gooyi is quite possibly the best Korean BBQ in the South Bay.
-It's not AYCE, but trust me, you don't need AYCE when you eat here.
-Depending on what prix fixe menu you choose, you will walk out totally full w/ leftovers.
-Their secret is the kimchi fried rice they will stir-fry right in front of you AFTER you've gorged yourself w/ the near-limitless ban chan (Korean side-dishes) & of course the fine cuts of meats that are BBQ'd in front of you.
-Speaking of the BBQ, I really love their heavy-duty cast iron grill pan, which traps the juices & doesn't burn much, which doesn't require many grill changes that you'll find in other Korean restaurants.
-The service is phenomenal, since they are 100% attentive & they'll cook most of the food for you.
-Finally, the absolute best part of eating here is if you have a hungry dog back home, they will pack you huge bones wrapped in foil and put into a plastic bag.

Overall, your job is just show up, have good conversations w/ your friends/family & enjoy the great Korean food at Gooyi Gooyi!",5,4,4,3,1
"This pho place is better than Kevin Noodle House. The pho doesn't taste like there is MSG in it and tastes very authentic. The owner is really funny and accommodating. This is definitely and undiscovered pho place that should get its recognition.

It was a rainy day and I was in the mood for some chicken so thanks to Yelp I found this little hole-in-the-wall. The nachos were very good with round tortilla chips.

"First time visit was Saturday night at 6:15 p.m. We were seated right away. Server (Christine)? was nice and introduced herself and was very helpful with the menu modifications as I don't eat anything spicy. She said they make each entree (with a few exceptions) as they are ordered. 

I had a Lychee Martini...Gooood...strong...two of these and I am not sure how I would have felt. Didn't try as we were off to a show.

We ordered the Lettuce cups and chose shrimp. Best I have ever had.
Then we had Lemongrass Chicken. Still had a spice in it but I survived; however, the spice overtook the lemongrass flavor. Was looking forward to that special flavor. We ordered the green beans with garlic and ginger and they held the ""heat"" and they were crisp and delicious.

We would go back but one caveat....unless you don't want to talk to your date, friend or spouse, go Sat. night for dinner. LOL....Didn't realize a few tables were outdoors or would have reserved that one. We walked outside after dinner and wow...you can't imagine how quiet it was.

"I remember going to their other location frequently when it first opened up but when it started getting very busy, the service became so terrible that it drove me away. I hated the attitude I was receiving from the female workers. I don't know what I did but the last few times I ate there got so bad I stopped going completely because of how I was treated. Which was unfortunate because I really really enjoyed their crawfish flavor/options. 

A few weeks ago while driving home on a route I usually never take, I saw this familiar logo! I stopped and excitedly walked into the new location conveniently in my Neighborhood! It was so empty so the service was quick and my son and I got our crawfish very quickly! It was so yummy! Our first order wasn't enough, so I ordered a second! I mentally rolled myself out of the restaurant because I ate so much crawfish. It was fresh and the crawfish were all big and meaty! 

It's much bigger than their other location and the service so far has been very quick and nice. I hope it stays that way because I really hate when employees start acting rudely because they can't handle a busy work environment. We all know how much good service means to me. 

I also like that it's not that far from Tastee & Pekoe, so I get to have my MT fix afterward just a few minutes up the road.",4,2,4,4,1

Ordered Wonton Soup, Beef & Broccoli, Chicken Chow Fun and was pleasantly surprised to find a side order of 4 spring rolls. Nice! Looking back over other reviews and folks have been getting these for awhile - maybe I thought we were ordering them with our food previous. Minus one for me, Plus one for Hunan!

Soup, B&B, CCF? Yea, those were top notch as well. Definitely worth it as the total bill was only $24 so reasonable in my book.

The restaurant is small and intimate. We had a nice table for four by the window. Our waiter was super funny and attentive. Now that I think of it -- all of the staff were courteous and exhibited the hospitality of a true local small business.

We ordered the unlimited mimosas and took advantage of the steal (literally! I'm glad I Lyfted) :-)

Check out the dishes we order -- photos attached to this review. Everything came out timely and hot from the kitchen.

"***4.5 Stars***

(Scrapes Plate)

Aaaand, that right there ladies and gentleman... WAS breakfast. The end. Brought to you by: Sherry's Kitchen. 

Yep. That's exactly how it went down. Except, this wasn't a movie. This was real life. Is it bad that I wanted to lick the plate clean too??? Okay... lemme stop playin' around and let's get to the ""actual review"".

Whatever you wanna call it; breakfast, brunch, lunch, a snack... Sherry's does it and does it well. Naw, naw, naw... it's surpassed ""well"". Sherry's does it RIGHT! This breakfast was BOMBSY!!! Simple, well executed, and delicious. 

I've been meaning to try Sherry's ever since they popped up on the scene a few months ago. 'Cause Shayla is a brunchin' gal! Yep, you got that right. Waltzed on in around 10 am on a beautiful Sunday morning, and the restaurant was bustling. I only had to wait a few minutes before I was sat. 

For a local brunch spot, they've got some serious variety on their menu. Some of their ""globally inspired"" breakfast options include loco moco, brats and eggs, spam and eggs, bacon wrapped sausage, and Portuguese linguisa scramble. YUM! Even with all of that variety, I chose the most basic of the basic aka their All-American breakfast. Went with their All-American and chose scrambled eggs, bacon, country potatoes, subbed my toast for a slice of their French bread French toast, and paired it with a hot chocolate. 

Not gonna lie... when I saw my hot chocolate being made with WATER... I freaked. And when I saw a ""Swiss chocolate"" packet being added to it... I freaked again. Two combos that should never go together when making hot chocolate. BUT... somehow, they made it work. 

Maybe it was the cute little mug that they put it in, or maybe it was the huge dollop of whipped cream and sprinkles on top. Whatever it was, the hot chocolate tasted pretty good. However, I had to dock half a star for that because that ain't no real hot chocolate. I probably wouldn't have dropped $3 on that had I known that it would basically be hot water with a Swiss chocolate packet. Thank goodness that it tasted okay. 

Aside from that little mishap, everything else was perfect!!! The scrambled eggs were perfectly scrambled, bacon was crispy and thick, and the country potatoes were perfectly crispy and practically melted in my mouth. LOVED their French bread French toast! It was nice and thick but still fluffy and void of any dryness. The butter was melting on top of that baby! What a great execution of a classic breakfast dish. It arrived to me piping hot and I wiped my plate CLEAN! Such an incredible breakfast.

Sheila was working her ass off and basically attending to most of the tables by herself, and she did it with a smile. Loved her whimsical personality and witty sense of humor. You would never know if she was stressed because she kept her cool during the entire brunch rush. Great customer service! My food arrived quickly as did my check when I was ready for it.

But wow, this place gets insanely busy for Sunday brunch! I guess I must have just beat the huge rush because by the time I left, there was a huge line of people waiting outside and a waitlist going. I would recommend coming in early to beat the rush. I can totally understand why this is brunch spot has quickly become a local favorite around town. They pair their delicious breakfast with amazing service, and I'm all about it!",5,16,23,22,1
"We are so glad there is finally a Thai restaurant near our home! Love ordering our regular: simple 911 roll (spicy tuna and jalape�����o on top of a crab, avocado, tempura shrimp roll), green curry with tofu, and garlic edamame. 

The last time we ordered our regular for pick-up during lunch time, we had to wait 45 minutes when they had said it would only take 20 minutes. Obviously, I was upset about that, but let it go. Then, I got home and opened up our order, ready to destroy our meal, and realized it was green curry with chicken. I was really upset that I had to wait 45 minutes for the wrong meal. 

I am updating my one star review today because we ordered our regular again, but tonight, the manager, Nat, answered and felt horrible that they had messed up our order previously.

"Yes! This place is as good as everyone says.

PARKING: Located in the same plaza as Uzumikaya and TP Tea it might be hard to find parking but I think if you are patient enough you'll find something, otherwise look on the street.

WAIT: Came on a Sunday evening around 6:30 pm and there was almost no wait in front of us but a lot of people eating. For a group of 6, we waited about 5 minutes before they got a table for us.

ATMOSPHERE: Inside is nothing super special, it's lively because of all the people eating together and they have more wooden tables. The people that work there speak Chinese so it was a bit hard to communicate beyond the general, this is what I want to order.

FOOD: Keep in mind that on the menu you can customize or choose what kind of noodles you want. If you don't specify, it will come with whatever is shown in the picture. Otherwise, you can go thin, medium or thickest noodle. After trying all of them, the thin noodles are actually the ""chewiest."" If you think of chew as when you bite into a noodle it springs back and has a bit of an al dente texture, you'll like the thin noodles better. The wider noodles are still ""chewy"" just more flat so they have less bounce/texture and are a bit more like flat pasta noodles.

I got the garlic pork noodles and asked for less spicy but it was still pretty spicy. If you can, try to ask for not spicy if you can't handle spicy. It seemed like those that got the dry dishes liked it a bit better than the soup but I'm sure it depends what you prefer.

The confusion came because my mom asked for medium spicy level but they thought she meant medium noodles. After a painstaking 5 minutes trying to ask which dish this was (my husband ordered the same one) and if these were the default/standard noodles or if they were supposed to be thin (they were supposed to be thin) we just said make it again. We're still unsure if it was the correct amount of spicy or not.

Overall, great if you like chewy noodle dishes.",4,2,8,5,1

The uni pasta is a must order. Perfect balance of creaminess and umami flavors. We also got the baked lobster crab roll. It was a little pricey at $20 but delicious.

The potato starter was amazing. Served with pancetta, cheese and tomatoes served warm. It was amazing and a good thing to share. 

The ribeye was cooked perfectly and presented with roasted cauliflower, truffle fries and a large portion of roasted bone marrow. As good as any steakhouse in the bay area. The pork loin was also cooked perfectly and served with some vegi's, pancetta and a wonderful chutney. Both dishes were amazing and i highly recommend even for the hearty eaters.

Still holds true to being my favorite place to get my Japanese food fix. Same goes for the boo!

For a place that's open later in the night, the quality is amazing. For sushi in this part of the bay, the quality is amazing. 
Im always severely disappointed when I go to other restaurants and order sushi. I have a fish allergy, so when I order the vegetarian rolls I can clearly see which places clean and which ones don't. Literally every other place I've gone to in the area has given me some sort of allergic reaction, except for ukai. What's even more of a bonus for me is that they have some creative veggie rolls! I don't just have to eat a bland avocado roll.. there's OPTIONS.

We got helped rather quickly for a Saturday night (right before closing!) and he was incredibly friendly. In addition, the quality and flavor of the food was genuinely good.

"This is purely a review for Happy Hour which is offered M-F 3-6 pm and Saturdays after 9:30 pm. Not sure if I rate them 4 stars otherwise. We came here on a Monday holiday and had a Carafe of Alfaro Pinot Noir -- which happens to be from one of our favorite local wineries, a Caprese Salad, Stuffed Peppadews, Truffle Salt Edamame, a Cheese and Meat Plate, and a Chicken Pesto Panini...grand total before tip was about $71 for 2. Not bad, but that was with Happy Hour $2 off appetizer plates, $4 of the Cheese and Meat Plate, and $8 off the carafe of wine on tap. My favorites were the Caprese Salad, Edamame and Stuffed Peppadews (sort of like pepperoncini stuffed with a cream cheese). The Cheese and Meat Plate where you get to pick 2 cheeses and 2 meats from a selection of each was just ok, but a bit on the small side (lots of crostini for a tiny block of each cheese and a few slices of each meat). The Chicken Pesto Panini served with a side salad was good, but not as memorable as the first time I tried one at Vino Vino in San Jose. This one was a bit thicker and breadier and not as well grill-pressed. Overall, food tasted decent, but it is simple fresh food to accompany wine, and not fine dining. We would return for Happy Hour if we happened to be in this part of town again, but probably not going to be our regular favourites list.",4,0,0,0,1
We walked in around 10:45 to a man smiling and greeted us as soon as we walked through the door. We walked up and he handed us a menu while explaining what their popular items are and even told us about how excited he was that they were a fairly new place and how well they've been doing since they opened as well as how he enjoyed the customers being so friendly. We ordered our food and he even gave us options of boba tea which we didn't expect them to have since they had mostly traditional Mexican food. We received our order and headed home and as soon as we got our tacos home they were gone in less than 60 seconds. They will always have a faithful customer in me as long as their food is consistently this great !!,5,0,1,1,1
"I came here for dinner with coworkers. We were seated inside between two large parties and it was really loud. The hostess was kind enough to move us outside so we could hear each other and enjoy our conversation.

"Their pineapple fried rice was the bomb! They actually serve it in a real pineapple; so when you scoop some fried rice, you can scrape the side walls and get some extra pineapple into your scoop!

I came here on a Saturday afternoon and I was surprised at how empty they were. Since they weren't busy, their service was very attentive. They have a lot of items & varieties in their menu. We ordered their chicken wings for our appetizers, their larb-beef and pineapple fried rice. I thought the prices were higher than normal for a Thai restaurant, but their portions were decent. As for parking, there is street parking, or you can park in a private lot that's located in the back of the restaurant. 

Overall I felt that this restaurant is more like a 3.5-star rating, but they do deserve to be rounded up to 4-stars for the quality of their food and the friendliness of their staff. I wouldn't mind coming back here again when I'm in the Cupertino area.",4,5,10,7,1

And we had the fish..perfectly crisp delicious cod, just wanted a bit more slaw and the red sauce was too spicy for us but still really yummy!!

"Hooray! I'm so happy that there is a burger lounge in Walnut Creek. Burger Lounge was one of our favorite places in San Diego, and I'm happy that they've made their way up to Northern California.

This location is pretty huge compared to the ones I used to frequent in San Diego, so seating is generally not a problem. The line to order can get long, but there's an app that you can order from as well.

The beef burgers here are grass-fed smash burgers that are cooked with a crust and served on a soft wheat roll. I love burgers and I am an unrepentant red-meat carnivore, but my favorites at Burger Lounge are the quinoa veggie burger and the turkey burger. Thee veggie patty here is by far the best I have ever tasted, and the turkey burger is superb.

For sides, I recommend the onion rings. Fries here are similar to In N Out fries, but thicker. They're decent, but nothing to write home about. The onion rings, however, are fantastic - crispy and breaded, they go great with the organic ketchup that is available.

The strawberry milkshake is another treat here. Made with real organic strawberries, it's probably the freshest milkshake you'll ever taste. My daughter loves it.

If you haven't done it yet, give Burger Lounge a try. It's an old favorite of mine, and I'm glad that there's one nearby!",4,0,0,0,1

What I like about the restaurant:
- Modern decor, nice private areas to sit. The wooden chairs are pretty and I guess they want to go for an authentic Thai touch, but they are kind of uncomfortable. 
- There is a call button on the table, so convenient! 

What I ordered:
- Thai Tea (free with check in)- not too sweet and it was perfectly iced. 
- Pad Thai: This is a Noddle place after all, so I couldn't resist trying a classic. The Pad Thai was great! Noodles weren't dry and the sauce was bomb! I also love their condiments (Thai pickled chilies, dry chilies, & chili paste).",5,1,2,3,1

"Wow, we came 10 minutes before they opened, first in line, woot.

Wednesday pop-up Duck Tsukemen they call it. Hot yo reserve in advance via IG or Facebook. Good thing Julie K. did, otherwise, we would get to try it. Yum. Pink color duck meat cooked to perfection!

Slurpy udon, thinner, long, and chewy texture, love it. Tasty dipping broth, just enough salt, onion, generous portion.

Wish they use this light sauce for Hamachi Carpaccio because, Hamachi sauce was too salty, and over dressing!

Oxtail was fall off the bone good. A little fatty for old farts like me. Next time I order regular udon and Oxtail on the side.

We also ordered Spicy broth on the side, only $1, so dam tasty good. I was sweating like a pig and loving it.

Chicken Karaage was good, a little on the dryer side, old oil maybe, but solid. Love the dipping sauce too!

Side order of Pok Choy, so that I feel less guilty stuffing my face with carb & fat, HA. Less than $1 for side order. THIS IS THE CHEAPEST TOPPING ADDING IN ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA! Thank you.

Our servers were good. They are attentive, care, and accommodating. For 2 people we ordered for 4, our server, a cute kid, in glasses, charming, in a beret, kindly enough offered us to move to a table for 4, which much better! Otherwise, what we ordered couldn't fit the table HA! Typical piggy me! I appreciate that, thank you!

"Very solid shabu shabu place. I've been here twice now and have enjoyed it both times. Broths are good but nothing too special, sauce bar is great for coming up with delicious combinations (basically goma + cilantro + anything is great). There's also ponzu, yuzu, soy sauce, minced garlic, minced radish.

Meats are sliced very very thinly and since they're about room temp they tend to stick to the metal tray and rip when you try to pick them up which is really annoying, but the flavor is good and servers are prompt at asking if you want to order anything else. 4 tray limit at a time.

The self-serve bar is awesome. There's a variety of fish balls, veggies, corn, noodles, clams, mussels, fish, crab, shrimp, eggs etc. I would skip the crab. I think it's pre-frozen so it tastes really mushy and not worth the effort to eat. I wish they had more leafy vegetable varieties besides chrysanthemum greens and bok choy. LOVE the fish balls, tofu, and quail eggs.

Service can be slow when it's busy. At a certain point our server clocked out and was about to leave his shift without letting us know or assigning another server to us. It can also get kind of messy when it's busy because no one is coming around to pick up trays or sweeping. In general servers are really friendly though.

For weekday lunch the price is SUPER reasonable, like $18 per person or something? Really hard to beat. Wait can get long around peak times so come early or around 4pm.",4,2,4,3,1
The food was really delicious. The cocktails were also really good. We got a burrata toast which was the best burrata cheese that I had in my life.

"Move over Bon Chon, this is my new go-to Korean fried chicken place! 

I ordered to-go on a Sunday evening, and although I will note below the few negative things I noticed, the chicken really does live up to the hype. 

We ordered the half crunch fried chicken and half crispy fried chicken (all wings). We also ordered a jap chae, which we didn't end up receiving (I'll explain below). 

First, the fried chicken. Wow, it's tender and crispy all at the same time. Personally, I thought the texture of the crunch fried chicken was better, but the flavor of the crispy fried chicken was better. The meat fell off the bone for both, so you really can't go wrong either way. I can sing its praises all day long, but the best way to find out for yourself is just to try! I'm already eyeing the other flavors and planning for my next visit.

Next, for the less-positive stuff. 
1) Between when I arrived to pick up my to-go order and when I left, it took probably close to 20 minutes or more (I wasn't really timing it, but I did check my watch prior to entering). That's really quite disappointing, considering I ordered like 40 minutes before I went to pick up the chicken. Apart from the other people waiting to grab to-go for delivery (UberEats or something), when the servers did get to me, I was told that they ""ran out of"" jap chae, and that they could give me something equivalent in price in exchange or a refund. (Otherwise, my food was ready). My husband and I were heading to a potluck, so this was a disappointing discovery; if they were out of jap chae, it should just be noted that they were out so that I didn't order it or I could have ordered something else ahead of time. What I was offered instead was a garden salad, which to be honest, I did not think was equivalent to jap chae nor should it be priced the same, but I digress. In the end, I had to wait at least 10 minutes for an uncooked garden salad, and I ended up being really late to the potluck despite my efforts to order ahead of time. 

2) While I was waiting for my garden salad, I was observing the rest of the restaurant. I saw many tables un-bussed with multiple groups waiting outside the restaurant to be seated. I could see the waiters and waitresses doing their best to juggle answering the constantly-ringing phone, give food to waiting to-go patrons, serve the dine-in patrons, and clean the tables. Unfortunately, it just seemed to be not such an efficient process. My takeaway was that I should just always get takeaway (ba-dum-tss). 

Anyway, although I wasn't as impressed with the service, I'll be back. The chicken really impressed me.",4,0,1,1,1
"The best korean fried chicken in the area!!

Vons (specifically this location!) is my go-to whenever I'm craving fried chicken. The batter is always the perfect amount of crispy while the chicken itself never fails to be juicy and tender. The garlic soy is a must! The honey butter is definitely a unique flavor to experience, but beware it's not for everyone's palate. I personally don't think I could commit to a whole order of it but I definitely could eat a piece or two.

I love coming in for their lunch special (11am-3pm) because you really get your ""bang for your buck"". It's only around $10 but it comes with sides of rice/fries and radish/coleslaw. The amount you get is pretty filling, I even usually end up taking leftovers to-go.

"I spent a LONG day at Corbin getting a custom seat made. The time span included lunch, and your options are VERY limited in the boonies - bring your own or Wizards.

I really was not expecting a whole lot. Let's face it...Wizards has a VERY captive audience - employees working on seats, and customers waiting on seats. That said, I was in for a pleasant surprise. They have a surprisingly full menu, including both breakfast and lunch - and at reasonably pricing. I opted for lunch - and ordered a bacon cheeseburger. I fully expected a kirkland cheap slab of burger on a similar bun. What I got was one heck of a slab of custom ground, cooked to perfection.

"It's our habit that we try our new places for special occasions. We picked up King of Thai Noodle for my wife's birthday. Pick was easy, so many super cool reviews already for this place. Not many guests were there when we reached. Could easily find a parking close to the restaurant. First impression was great - we were greeted by the lady who was in charge and gave us a nice table with a good outside view - but totally forgot to gave us the menu. It took a while for her to realize that we were waiting for the menu for our order. This place has got a gorgeous interior and great ambience. 

We ordered Pad Kee Mao (with Chicken), Thai Style Fried Rice with Chicken (without Egg), Spicy Eggplant over Rice (with Chicken) and Curry Puff for Appetizer. And there was a Thai Iced Tea as a Yelp Check-in perk. They took some time to get us the food. Noticed there was only that lady to handle everything and she was losing track of things she has to do. When the food was served, she served the Thai Style Fried Rice with egg. She completely forgot to mention about our special instruction to make that one egg-less. She apologized and offered to prepare that again. Unfortunately that never arrived until we were done and ready to go. We had to take that as a to-go. 

The Pad Kee Mao was really delicious - one of the best I have ever tasted. Spicy eggplant was really 'spicy' - an we loved it with the white rice served alongside that. Curry Puff was a totally different appetizer than I was expecting. But it was a pleasant surprise. Really enjoyed that one and glad that we picked up that one after debating a lot about it prior to order. In fact the Thai Style Fried Rice we picked up to-go was also delicious. No real complaint about the food. 

Food is great, this place is super cool. The cons would be the dysfunctional service and the high volume music. I am not sure the terrible service was only on that day under some special circumstances, but they need to sort that one out. So as the volume of the EDM they keep on playing - they have to keep that down a little bit. It wasn't just us, but the other family with a little kid were also quite annoyed by the music. Having said, I would recommend this place for their food. Its delicious and awesome. Will definitely try this place again very soon.",4,0,3,2,1

"Ichiraku Ramen is a small ramen joint in the Richmond district. They have a simple menu with three ramen broths - tonkotsu, black garlic tonkotsu, and red garlic tonkotsu. They have a yelp waitlist so make sure to get on the waitlist before you come to avoid any waiting.

I chose the black garlic tonkotsu which was topped with bean sprouts, black fungus, bamboo shoots, soft boiled egg, pork chasu, and green onions. The broth was amazingly flavorful and garlicy. The pieces of pork were extremely thin, so order extra if you need your protein. My egg was a little overdone as well (see pic). I tried my friend's red garlic broth and found it a little sweet for me. It was not as spicy as it looks.

Seafood pancake - can honestly say this is the best or at least one of the best. I lived with 3 different Korean roommate back in my college days, I eat Korean food all the time. Not just a one timer bragging about the food but it's really that good. 

Combo short rib with cold buckwheat noodles. Mmm nom nom nom! I like how they do combo with spicy noodle and cold noodles, a lot of places only so soft tofu soup but they have options, the cold buckwheat noodle was hella good. I like how it came together. This is one of my favorite Korean noodle dish so my expectations is high and they def met my standard. Even though it was a combo I think this is the full size version. The short rib only came with 5 pieces wish it was a bigger portion.

Jap chae was on point, good flavor and noodles still chewy very good

Grilled mackerel was good too. Wish I ordered the full size version the lunch portion only come with 1 piece and it's $11.99 I think the dinner portion come with 2 piece for $16.99

Banchan was good, lots of choices my fave are the anchovies. Overall a very very very good Korean place in the area! Would def return and try their other chefs special.",5,5,0,1,1
"The long lines outside make sense...there's so little seating inside! Be ready to sit closely next to strangers on the community style tables. Would be nice if they could move to a larger space in the future. But the location isn't too bad. It's not smack dab in downtown so I was able to find parking on a Friday night. Ramen itself is good. Ramen isn't really my thing though. I am still on the quest to find something Ichiran-esque because that was the only time I was blown away by ramen. I hope to find that again in this lifetime....

Anyways...broth is good, but thicc like others say. Like a sauce. The menu did say rich and creamy though. Maybe the other ramens on the menu have more traditional broth consistencies? Noodle consistency is also thicc and...al dente? Like firm. Which is great because who likes soggy noodles? The pork is really good and soft. The egg was good, a little sweet. It is an extra cost to add it though. I had the spicy tori paitan, friends had tori paitan, and we shared the mushroom chips and a lychee sake. Spiciness level is about mild to medium, no levels to choose from but when you get it you can decide if you want to take some of the spicy flakes out before you mix it in with the rest. Lychee sake was very sweet, I wouldn't order it again. Perhaps the drier one is the better choice for next time. I loved the mushroom chips! I'd order those again. They reminded me of fried crunchy noodles.",4,0,2,2,1
"I'm making a bold statement here.. but I can confidently say this was the best bowl of bun bo hue I have EVER had. The bowl may be somewhat small but all the flavors pack a punch.

I'm used to having all in one bowl but I like the option to choose as well. 

There's a sign in sheet on a clip board and a bit of a wait for dinner. I came on a Sunday night and waited 20-30 minutes. 

Central Viet food is about the small plates. I'd get a variety to share. Banh beo was larger than most I've had and comes with 5 in an order. The banh nam isn't the best I've had but the sauce they give with it here is unique.

It reminded me of being back home and I was happy to see it was not an imitation NY pizza Place. Start yourself off with a cheese pie. They have a wide variety of pizzas to try and portion sizes are perfect. The customer service was the best! Definitely recommend to Yelpers in search of a good pizza! Street parking only and their is limited seating inside.",5,1,1,1,1
"YAAAAAASSSSSS! They opened up a Claw Shack near me! I was a fan of the Claw Shack on Berryessa, but I am ALSO a fan of this location! So, the Berryessa location is where I would actually sit down and eat. I only did take out at this location, but the flavor was there. Also, service was friendly as well.

I ordered combo #1: crawfish and shrimp with head. The combos come with corn, sausage and potatoes! I always get the shackie's hot, which is thick and creamy! I've never really tried any other seasoning besides the shackie's, so I can't really say much about the other seasonings. But, I can for sure say that you can't go wrong with the shackie's seasoning!

I will definitely come back to dine-in since it is closer to me. This location seems bigger and the parking lot is bigger as well. Claw Shack is definitely one of my go-to seafood boil spots in the Bay Area.",5,1,2,4,1
"I've always wanted to check out Jupiter and finally came with friends on a Friday night. 

The outdoor patio was so lovely and dreamy surrounded by trees and decorated with strings of light. They also had a live band playing jazz and a fire pit. I was totally smitten! My friend and I came after a happy hour at a nearby restaurant so we weren't hungry. We each ordered a sake margarita which tasted great. Another friend joined us an hour later and we shared a small xanthia pizza. It was decent but I would have liked something more traditional with sauce. Service was friendly and efficient. 

Overall, I think this is an awesome spot to spend a Friday or Saturday night. No wonder it's so popular. I'd totally return to hang out and try more of their pizzas especially when the jazz band is playing!",4,3,5,6,1

Parking lot was really small. Two spots dedicated specifically for the restaurant and then a couple more dedicated to the liquor store next door. Then random spots unidentified. 
I wish every dish on the menu had pictures next to the descriptions. It was a little hard to tell what the dishes were, soups, noodle dish, pan fry, not sure.

"I've been coming here for many years and it is one of my top three favorite restaurants of all time. We've gone as far as to buy out the restaurant for a corporate dinner and boy did they make me look good. They truly blew everyone away with their incredible food and top notch service. I continue to recommend them to anyone in the area looking for good eats and I've not had anyone come back unhappy. I even send hotel ppl and chefs from catering companies to show them what caliber I'm looking for. 
I went back for lunch with some friends on Friday afternoon and as always we left in a satisfied happy stupor. Loved every morsel of the meal and a special treat to see Angela!

I've only tried three items off the menu, and I would definitely reorder two out of the three. They were the Sichuan spicy dumplings and the spicy fries. The sauce is what makes the dumplings tasty, and the fries are not too spicy and are cooked in a wok.

The braised pork noodles was the last dish. While the pork was flavourful, the sauce was bland against the noodles. It needed more salt.

The food is made fresh. I'm not sure if that's good to some people. You get a pager and have to wait for your food. I think it's worth the wait and the people behind the counter are nice.",4,0,7,0,1
"I am extremely pleased to be updating my review for Forbes Mill Steakhouse. 
Their general manager, Enrique Martinez, alone deserves five stars AND a standing ovation, simply for his efforts in going above and beyond to remedy our poor dining experience from OVER A YEAR AGO. 
In fact, Enrique reached out to me via Yelp shortly after I posted a review detailing our disappointing time and inadequately made food. However, I did not view his message nor respond to him until months later. Yes, my fellow Yelpers, you read that right. Months later (*insert embarrassed emoji!). 
In short, Enrique responded straight away and before I knew it, dinner reservations were made for my husband and I.

We had dinner at Forbes Mill Steakhouse on Wednesday evening and it was a complete 360! WOW!
First, the restaurant itself was brimming with energy from its many customers. The sounds of laughter and happy chatter filled the air. To us, that was a great sign as our prior visit was the complete opposite.

We ordered - 

Jumbo Prawns Cocktail - 4 truly jumbo prawns sitting in an ice cold glass with tangy cocktail sauce and freshly grated horseradish. I love all seafood cocktails and to me, this is the ideal appetizer.

Wedge Salad (split) - whenever I see ""wedge salad"" on the menu, I order it. One might think ""eh, how can anyone screw up a wedge salad?"". Trust me, it happens. The wedge salad here had the perfect ratio of blue cheese to pancetta to red onion to lettuce. It wasn't drowning in dressing nor was it thirsting for dressing. It was just right =)

Surf & Turf (filet mignon & lobster tail) - I had to give this another try.... And I'm thrilled that I did! I rarely eat beef so the size of the filet mignon was appropriate for me and it was incredibly delicious! Cooked to juicy perfection. The accompanying lobster tail was tender and provided the perfect balance with each bite of filet. I, without a doubt, enjoyed my main course. 

Prime Blackened Ribeye & added lobster tail - This was hubby's main course choice and it arrived topped with crispy onions along with a side of scalloped potatoes. According to the hubby, every single item on his plate was scrumptious. Savory rich scalloped potatoes with a tasty steak.....zero complaints from him =) 

In addition, we also had an order of the loaded baked potato and jalapeno mac & cheese. Halfway through our meal, we realized that we indeed had enough food for 4 people! But since we had genuinely enjoyed each dish, we happily took home the leftovers... which we devoured the very next day.

To summarize, hubby and I had a truly lovely time dining at Forbes Mill Steakhouse. We can't thank Enrique, our server (shame on me for not recalling his name) and the staff enough for the impeccable service throughout dinner. The complimentary dessert (we were also celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary) was the perfect (and delectable) way to end our evening. 
After this experience, hubby and I would gladly choose Forbes Mill over Morton's, Flemings, or Ruth's Chris. No joke.

PS - thank you for reading! Apologies for the long review but, in my opinion, Forbes Mill and Enrique deserve to be recognized for their efforts! If you had a less than stellar dining experience at Forbes Mill, do give them another chance =)",5,1,6,6,1

Take yo order at the front- menu is on the right side on the wall. Grab yer number and find a seat! Definitely gets packed here so take a look around if you wanna wait, but food takes a bit to cook so don't worry if no seats quite yet.

Single bathroom in the corridor- mostly a wait so scope it out when you need to go. 

Calamari - took a while to cook but well worth the wait. The kitchen felt bad and gave us some more chicken as a sorry- which was super nice and not needed, but very thankful they did.

The clam chowder in the sourdough was great- can't mess it up! :)

Chicken was moist and served piping hot~ the bread was nice and soft but somewhat crispy on the outside mm. Fries here are so-so but everything else was great.

"Oh my gosh! The jerk chicken plate here is divine. Full of flavor and also a very good quantity. It definitely filled me up. I got the jerk white chicken plate and I have zero regrets. 

This is a pretty small place and gets filled up real quick. They have outside seating too. Parking situation - street parking so you may or may not get lucky with it during leak hours. Lots of housing in that area. So you might need to be a little patient. 

They have fresh juices too but I'm not sure if I'll get them again. Yes, it definitely tasted great with the food, but is was VERY sweet. So if you enjoy sugar in your drinks, you'll love it, if not, you'll find it extremely sweet.

"I feel so lucky that this building, BWW, is my second home. I just roll downstairs after my last class and it's opening time at Marugame! Cafeteria-style udon has been long overdue near campus, and I'm such a big fan of this chain (you could go diggin through my old reviews hehe). It's so simple and straightforward, going down a conveyor belt of fresh-made udon, soup base of choice, and rotating tempura a la carte. You can really customize and get as little or as much as you want!

This restaurant takes up the whole corner of the block, so there's plenty of seating. Despite the lines, you will get served fast since you'll get your food right away when you enter. And there are so many people working behind the scenes to get you that food asap ;) Right now, they are only open for dinner starting at 4pm.

"its been yeaaarss since coming here and remember coming here for Spanish class (with Ms Jimenez!) for a field trip back in high school. Food has always been delicious but used to opt for their 'competitor' next door which is now closed....and with so many Mexican restaurants/tacquerias in Hayward you wanna try the latest and greatest. 

Shredded beef burritos are the best...always comes out piping hot..the best crunchy tortilla chips around...on the thicker side but it seems the locals seem to just order large bags and quart of salsa to go...that tells you something. 

Great food, reasonably priced, plenty on street parking in Downtown Hayward...and with the Hayward Loop (traffic nightmare) 'forcing' you to make those LEFT turns in rush hour traffic may be the only plus of this 'great idea' by the City of Hayward....it will get you to Los Compadres on C Street!

This is my favorite local pho spot! I never got the chance to try the restaurant when it was around years ago but I am so glad that they returned.

"Took my wife here for her bday. Made reservations on a friday night and itbwas packed. 

As we enetered, there was live music and singing. The ambiance really resembled italy.

The staff quickly greeted and sat us down. 

Got the calamari for appetizer. Super crunchy, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked squid inside. Cant go wrong with the calamari. (Huge portion for 2)

My wife ordered the carbonara. The pasta was fresh and sauce was creamy. Nicely cut prosciutto. Good texture and great flavors

I ordered the strip steak special. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. Steak was a bit tough but the seasoning on it was very good. The risotto was my favorite part of this dish. Well balanced, well seasoned, accompanied with shitake mushrooms. Veggies were also good. 

Desserts; lava cake and tiramisu 
Lava cake was good but not enough fudge in the middle to ooze out. Either that or the cake was overcooked but it was still pretty good. The ice cream that came with it was not good at all. It had so many ice chips within the ice cream so it took the creaminess away from it. 

Tiramisu was amazing. Light, airy, soft, smooth. Everything you imagined in a tiramisu cake, this place had it. So many good flavors going on and every bite made u wanting more.

Definitely would come back here. Highly reccomended.",4,6,0,2,1
I've been here a couple of times and both were great experiences. One of the days was on a Monday were they had $1 oysters. At first I thought how good could they be? Surprisingly big and delicious.

"I have been a loyal patron of this (the first but not the largest) Hawaiian BBQ franchise restaurant chain for ~15 years.

The outlet on Redwood Road in Castro Valley serves up L & L 's famous menu items. My fav has always been their Chicken Katsu. D-E-L-I-S-H-I-O-U-S-N-E-S-S!

Their macaroni salad is creamy awesomeness in under a few 100 calories (more or less). The best thing I like about L&L, they don't chintz on the rice. It is almost as good as the brand that I buy for home consumption.

I like L&L b/c their menu items are very consistent from location to location. The Chicken Katsu at one location is EXACTLY the same at almost every other. So......you know what you're going to get when you walk into an L&L franchise.

While there are now so many Hawaiian BBQ outlets to choose from in the East Bay, my favorite go-to spot for Hawaiian BBQ is still, the one, and only...L&L.

"This place is frequented by my bestie and her b whom introduced me to this place. 

After a long day of work, I decided to drop by here with my other bestie who works with me. We had a long, rough and grueling week so this was our #treatyoself meal for #tgif.

We came around 4ish and it wasn't totally busy yet, so we got sat right away. 

We ordered two orders of egg rolls and the lady taking our order commented ""2 ordah, tew much!"" But we laughed and replied ""Not at all"" because their egg rolls really are pretty amazing. Definitely a must order and are better than average egg roll anywhere else. 

I usually get a beef stew with egg noodle, but of course, they ran out as I somewhat expected this. So I got my second go to which is Tai pho , just plain rare steak. 

My friend ordered the combination soul with a little of everything, i.e. chicken, fish ball, quail egg, and other things. 

We went from starving to happily stuffed. 

This place is a little pricier than most places. Your average pho place might cost you $7-8 a bowl , but this place charges $10-sumthing for medium/large bowl. They're egg roll appetizer was $6.70ish bucks which I think elsewhere might charge $4-5 bucks for small appetizers. 

Conclusion, delicious food! But just a tad pricier here than your average Pho restaurant. But well worth it.",5,2,4,5,1
"Wow, the noodles did not disappoint!! We ordered the beef stew noodles soup and beef stir fry noodles (clearly a common theme of the night of beef and noodles...)

Both dishes came out super quickly. The noodle soup broth was delicious, hearty, umami-filled... all the things you want in a comforting soup. We thought we were full but then the stir fry noodles came out -- we destroyed that too.

"Hayes Valley is filled with bougie dinner spots, and this is one of many. Price per dish here is definitely slightly cheaper than Z�����rich, Switzerland, and it is obvious because the cost of living here is a little less. We were a party of 3 seated in a communal table, because the table set-up often involves a few large tables, which is typical of a lot of modern restaurants here. What's nice here is that you can opt out of bread, which for most of us think it's free, because if you were to go to an authentic Swiss-German place in Switzerland, you get the bread then later realize you were charged in the bill.

Because I just went to Switzerland 2 weeks ago, I have a strong point of comparison to see how this restaurant fares. For the potato pancakes, they were okay. There was a slight tinge of burnt flavor but the texture is good: crispy on the outside, sufficiently soft inside. The sour cream is a bit more creamy than usual, which is nice. The apple sauce has a slight cinnamon touch and is sufficet to make it a light dessert in addition to an appetizer. 

For the schitzel, the breading is quite similar to the ones I tried when I ate cordon bleu and schnitzel, which is good. The pork, however, is a bit too dry to my liking, compared to the juicier versions I have tried. The potatoes are a bit on the mushy side, but they are nonetheless flavorful. 

The sausage is a pretty popular dish here. While size does not matter (mmm), the sausage is not that juicy compared to the selection of bratwursts I have tried in my trip. The mashed potatoes are decent and the sauerkraut has great aroma. I suppose they made it alongside grilled onions because that is honestly the highlight of this otherwise mediocre dish.",4,0,1,0,1

The cashier was super friendly and made the first interaction with this spot super chill. Shoutout to him for the friendliness and good customer service! It was fairly busy around 4:00PM when I came in, so the food came out in about 15 minutes. 

The candy fried chicken is for sure a must cop. They're the perfect balance between sweet and savory, and the combination of juicy chicken meat and crunchy skin was tasty! I heard that sometimes these sell out early on in the day, and I can see why! This is a must try for sure.

The garlic noodles were also pretty good! They weren't too wet like some garlic noodles usually are and had a nice flavor and bite to them. The sisig fries were probably my least favorite thing... but they were still good! They could have used some more sauce, and the sisig itself could have been a little less dry. I think I found myself gravitating towards the garlic noodles more because I was looking for more moisture. For a bite they'd be good, but I'd rather get something else. It'd be 5/5 if not for these fries, but the other food was so good I gotta give them props!

"Been wanting to try their huge fried chicken. They offer the huge piece of chicken in either thigh or breast piece. The price of the chicken was pretty steep for what you are getting. It was about $10 for this chicken which is essentially the same as popcorn chicken at any other boba shop. It was cool to eat such a large piece of chicken like that, but I don't think it's worth the price. I rather go get two orders of regular popcorn chicken for that price. I like that the order is freshly fried. It was crispy and we'll seasoned. You can get a range of spicy. Mine was pretty spicy, just the way I like it. You can also get your chicken cut up so it'll be easier to share.

Overall, cool to try for the first time but will probably just go to boba shops and get an order of popcorn chicken.",4,1,2,3,1

The sauce itself was a strong pesto, which tasted fresh and did pair well with the type of pasta. Overall I did feel the dish was of high quality.

It's my first time try the lamb offal. In surprise, the soup is umami and tasty. 
Chef's special lamb shumai: I love the shrimp shumai or pork shumai in the dim sum place. Sure, lamb shumai is also yummy and novel. 
Sauteed beef stuffed pancake: the marinated beef and crispy pancake are perfect combination. 
Scallop with chili oil: It taste okay, but not my favor.
Chinese yam topping with blueberry jam: I will take out one point because of these. Be aware that those are raw Chinese yam. I think it will taste better if they change to steam Chinese yam.

Great location with a couple of sides having a view of the bay. As you might imagine, menu options are heavily on the seafood side but they have burgers and steaks too.......but..... 

I was torn with so many options but decided on the Cioppino. They offer a lazy option where all the seafood is ""shelled"" for you but this is one time I wasn't going to be lazy. Count on getting messy with some random splatters as you enjoy the seafood tomato broth. There's really no other way than to just ""get in there.""

Whenever I see bossam on a menu I have to try it! In my (amateur) opinion, Silla's bossam is more traditional than the one at Jang Su Jang. They serve it with raw oysters, fresh jalapenos, and slices of garlic. The pork belly was tender and the kimchi was perfect with it.

We also got the spicy stir-fried squid. Be warned - it was spicy! I liked the sweet and savory sauce, but there was a little too much. We had to really dig around to find the squid among the cabbage and green onions.

The banchan was just okay. The best one being the dried squid; it was quite flavorful.

I'd definitely come back for the bossam and the atmosphere.",4,1,4,4,1
"I finally made it here!! Another spot off of my bookmarks

I tried making reservations on line but everything was booked for the specific date and time I was trying to go. I did read that they limit reservations so that they can accommodate walk-in guest. Perfect we headed straight to Angelines.

I checked in and was advised there was about a 40 min wait. No problem I peeped a bar rt a few doors down!! 

I received a text msg pretty much within the time frame that they told me that our table would be ready and just in time for us to finish our drinks at the other spot.

We were seated immediately and our waiter came right away with our menus. 

For starters we ordered hush puppies and a cup of gumbo. The Gumbo was great!! Very flavorful and a pretty good portion considering it was a cup (we shared it) the hush puppies were very good also. 

We decided to share an entree because we noticed the portions were pretty big. We ordered the Cajun mixed grill which is Ribs, potato salad, sausage and shrimp that is covered with this creamy/spicy sauce that is very good. We also had a side of baked mac and cheese.

The food was great, very authentic and full of flavors, the Mac and cheese was awesome, top layer was had a crunch and the inside was nice and warm, talk about ""comfort food""

Customer service is awesome. Our waiter was very nice and efficient.

Only draw back was the tables are kind of too close to each other. There was a family sitting next to us and the seating is so tight it almost felt like we are all at the same table... parking can be hard, I had to park 3 blocks down.....",4,2,4,3,1
"We got here before they opened on a weekend and within 10 minutes of the restaurant opening their doors, the whole place is filled. Obviously, they have lines out the door, but the lines don't actually look that long. 

The place is very open and in the shape of a square with this forest wall painting and monarch butterfly motif. I assume it's like you're dinning in the forest as the seats and tables are made out of wood. They have tables along the sides of the store, but the center row is essentially a long bench that can seat 8 chairs. I think this is a good idea as they can pack more people in, but it just feel a bit more casual and slightly close to other parties.

I was slightly put off by their menu, some of the items don't look that appetizing, but believe me, their actual food is better than advertised. Or maybe they want to lower your expectations so that you'll get super impressed fast. I don't know how marketing works these days. 

Anyway, their chicken and short rib are out until after noon, like 12 or 12:30PM. I was really looking forward to the chicken but ended up with a spicy beef noodle. The beef is more spongey, a mix of meat and something else. The noodles are unevenly cut because it's hand pulled. You'll know this as they have their logo of a guy pulling the noodles apart, stretching it. It's not that spicy, it's mostly there for the flavor. My mom always told me to finish the meat first and leave the rice behind. But this time, I ended up finishing the noodles and leaving the meat behind. It's just too good!

The portions are big so expect to be very full after! The place is very casual and great for a quick bite!",4,0,0,0,1

"This place has great Korean fried chicken! Their flavors are great - honey butter and cheddar are so unique! 

The honey butter and sweet cheddar have a lil sweet kick. (5/5) 
The yangnyeom is forsure a must try - the chicken doesn't stay as crispy but the flavor is worth it. (4.5/5)

Chicken is crispy and moist - my new go-to for Korean fried chicken!",5,1,1,1,1
"Came here for a special dinner with my cousin + her husband and my sister. We ordered the sea bass, rib eye steak, duck confit, and veal chop. Everything arrived in big plates and in under half an hour, which was really nice given that it was dinner rush (~ 6 pm). I ordered the veal chop but tried all the other dishes: the sea bass was very good, and the rib eye was quite literally one the best steaks I've ever had. 

The veal chop was prepared by the chef's standard of medium rare and very soft, with a parmesan kind of crust on top. The brussels sprouts were oily and baked very crispy. YUM. :) 

Also, the drinks menu is really reasonable given that the rest of the menu is fancier. A Stella is $7 and the red wine blend that I had (which was actually just a Zinfandel) was $13. 

I only have good things to say about this place. I highly recommend Nick's for anyone who wants to treat their guests for a lovely evening. Keep up the great work, Nick et. al!",5,1,6,2,1
"I was visiting a good friend of mine and she had heard about this new dumpling place near her house that just opened up so we decided to try it out. 

We walked over and put our names down, and there was about a 20 minute wait for our party of three. The restaurant is still very new and rather small inside so they are still having some growing pains.

Service is good but the employees are new so they are still trying to figure out their flow.

The menu has a decent number of items though it is still ""soft opening"" phase. Overall, it is a dumpling/noodle/pastry house.

As for the food, I loved all of the varieties of dumplings and that they are all made-to-order in-house. You can really taste the difference and I love that they use thick freshly rolled out dumpling skins. FYI: one order of dumplings consists of 14 dumplings.

The green onion pancake is also phenomenal, so flaky and delicious. The beef noodle soup was okay, not as spicy as I was expecting considering the Sichuan in the dish name.

Prices are also incredibly reasonable with everything under $10. 

I am unable to give five stars at this point because it is not perfect yet and it's not the best food I have ever had, but they are really trying very hard and are very new so give them a chance. It's definitely an amazing neighborhood eatery.",4,0,3,2,1
"Came here with a group of friends. I shared a quesadilla plate and an order of chips and salsa. Their quesadilla plate was huge!! I think we got a chicken quesadilla (not sure the exact name). The quesadilla was cut into three large pieces and came with a side of salad. Inside the quesadilla was beans, cheese, chicken, veggies, and maybe a few other stuff I don't remember. It was really filling though! I would get it again. Also, we had just came back from the gym so it was something on the healthier/ less carby side on the menu so it would feel like we just killed out workout from the meal. 

We also shared some chips and salsa. The salsa bar was unlimited. There was several salsa options from mild to spicy and variety of flavor options. My favorite was the pico salsa because of the chunks of tomatoes and onions. If you wanted more chips, you just have to bring your empty bowl back to the counter for refill. 

We also got one of their blended margaritas. It's a very large cup, pretty strong drink and delicious. 

This is a self service restaurant. Pay at the counter and your order will be brought to you. Free range on seating, so it was kind of hard to find seating for our group because it was so busy that night.

Pretty filling meal to share between two people. I would come back if I'm in the area.",4,1,2,3,1
"I've been living in Koreatown, Los Angeles, for 4 years so I've had my giant share of korean fried chicken (Kyochon, Gol Tong, you name it). I came home for the weekend to visit family, and my sister was craving kfc so we decided to check this spot out. I used to go here when this place was Chicken on Fire so I already was expecting it to very small (27 people max capacity) with maybe two to three people running it. The one running the cashier was a lady and her husband was the one cooking in the back. 

We ordered 1 large order of chicken wings (half spicy, half soy garlic) and sweet potato fries. The wings were huge! The way I would describe the taste of Volcano Island spicy wings is that it's similar to Chicken on Fire but more on the milder side. The soy garlic wings are almost identical as well but more on the lighter side. Sweet potato fries were cooked on point (not soggy).

In comparison to koreatown chicken wings I'd give this place a 3.0. but in comparison for what's in the East Bay, I give it a 4.5 behind Chicken on Fire.",4,0,2,1,1
"I wish we had this place in DC!

The shrimp rice rolls and shrimp dumplings were the best I've tasted, ever!! And it was sooooo cheap and filling! I wish our stomachs were bigger to eat more because it was just that good.

"Right before entering this place, my husband and I were debating on how I have been very generous with reviewing restaurants as I mostly mark them 5/5. So eventually I ended up with being more stringent and observant with this place. But irrespective of my being super observant, this place convinced me of what a 5/5 level should be like!

This was the first Ethiopian restaurant that I have been to and no doubt will be going back again many more times. The insides are beautiful with all Ethiopian decoration. We went on a Friday night and there was a long line, we waited for about 40 mins for our table. Keep about 2 hours in mind when going to this place since its super crowded and they have limited staff so it takes them some time for orders. 

For food, if you are a first timer(like me), I would recommend getting their meat/vegetarian combo which includes small portions of their best sides with the bread. Also must try their Tej(Honey wine) which was something very different and tasted superb! We ended our meals with Baklava and Ethiopian Tea and Coffee. The tea again was something very different and tasted like clove!

I am definitely going back there pretty soon and taking my family too with me this time!",5,4,3,2,1
"Let's just take a moment to appreciate the awesome artwork at this fine establishment. When I saw the tribute to thongs (No things except on feet!) sign, I bursted out laughing. I was highly amused by the decor and funny signs. I stumbled on this place on a late Fourth of July. I decided to bravely see the fireworks at Pier 39 for Fourth of July. I stumbled on this place by chance and wanting to wait for the crowd to simmer down, I'm so happy I did! 

My boyfriend and I were tempted by the cool surfboards and the promise of good ole bar and grill style food. We were seated promptly and appreciatively next to a fire pit in the outside seating area. It was fun to people watch and see people try to make the long trek home through the insane crowds. We were really content to be sitting there and enjoying the view. 

The waitress was super friendly and attentive with us throughout the night. There's so many choices, but I settled on the al pastor burrito and my boyfriend had the carne asada burrito. The burritos were a good portion in size filled with delicious marinated meat, black beans, rice, roasted tomato's salsa, cheddar and jack cheese, and a hint of spiciness. Overall, the burrito was so flavorful and I was happy with the handfuls of crispy tortilla chips. We enjoyed the pomegranate margarita, I liked the tiki style glasses with the colorful umbrellas. 

We got the chance to have a lovely sit down dinner with great food and even better service. I'll always remember that night fondly and I'm really happy I gave this place a try.",4,5,11,10,1
"Mmmm 5 days later and I am still thinking about the menudo soup from Los Moles. 

My friends and I came here for dinner before a night of kareoke. We kind of randomly chose this place because we saw they had a TV to watch the Warriors game. Wow what a lucky pick! A friend and I arrived an hour early to catch the whole game, and we sat at the bar to enjoy some drinks and salsa. The traditional michelada was delicious but whoo spicy! It was so good we got a pitcher to supplement our dinner buffet.

The buffet was so good! Naturally we got buffet because we were starving and the entrees were around the same price. Might as well get AYCE. I probably didnt eat enough though, but I wanted to! There was rice, pulled stewed meats, beans, soups, and so many different types of mole -- all delicious! Get the beef menudo!

"Service: the service is mediocre at claw shack. They were very attentive prior to the food coming out. They checked three times to see if we were ready to order, offered us limes, brought us our waters, and then out came our order. And after that, they never checked on us again. The order did come out pretty quick after ordering though, which is a plus! They do not bring the check to you. Or not that I know of at least. We paid at the counter after sitting confused for five minutes... haha

Food: we ordered two combos - shrimp + mussels in the shambalang sauce and clams + crawfish in the shackie's sauce. Each combo came with potatoes, corn, and sausages. We also ordered a side of garlic noodles to share between four people. The crawfish was big and fresh!! Which I loved because I'm a huge fan of crawfish. Their sauce is good, not going to lie. However, I still like Kickin Crab better. Kickin crab has the best garlic noodles because it actually tastes garlicky. Whereas the noodles at claw shack, you can taste more of the savory sauces (soy sauce?) flavor in it and not much garlic. Claw shack's quality of seafood is better though. 

I'm not sure if it was me but each combo bag did not seem to have a lot. There wasn't a lot of clams or crawfish compared to when I ordered a combo bag at Kickin Crab... the combo I ordered at kickin crab (3 lbs of assorted seafood) filled 3 people total, while the combined two combos at claw shack didn't leave any of us full, and there was 4 of us. Just thought I'd throw that in there for size comparisons.

In conclusion, do give this place a try if you've never had before! It's always good to try different seafood boil restaurants out because each place has their own special flavor. Just because I personally like Kickin crab more doesn't mean you shouldn't stop by claw shack. You may think this place is the best!! Everyone's taste buds are different :)",4,5,4,4,1

"Our entire family loves this place. We eat here atleast once a month. Their food quality is very good. It never disappoints us.

We like it better than the beef. Don't get me wrong they're good but the pork is the best. Their meat comes on this sizzling cast iron plate. It's shareable between 2-3 people. The best time to come here is during their lunch time. They have a lunch menu special, it looks like a bento box plus the cast iron plate meat. It's pretty worth it. It has the rice, salad, tempura, noodles, potatoes & bean sprouts. Also they give you some more sides as well. This place gets packed all the time.

"We've lived in the area for a year now and it dawned on us that we hadn't had Lebanese food since arriving. A quick search of Yelp found Shish Grill not too far from our home.

We were very happy with the selection of the menu and that vegan items are labeled clearly as such. The fatoush salad was great, although could use a touch more citrus for my liking. I will ask for a bit more on my next visit. The falafel wrap was good with usual toppings. For a real treat, ask for the house hot sauce. It really lights the wrap up if you like things spicy.

It seems odd to wirte this for a Lebanese place, but their french fries were great. I don't know if it is the same for all orders, but both orders of fries at our table were fresh fried so they were hot and crispy. Not something I go out of my way to look for, but it was a nice surprise. For the non-fry loving people, note that you can substitute the default fries for a salad or hummus.

Lastly, the same family just opened a Lebanese grocry next to the restaurant. If you like what you had there, go next door and you can buy a lot of the sauces, dips, bread, etc.",4,0,3,1,1

This place is custom designed for a date night - you can't go wrong with the chic modern interiors, soft music and that awesome complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic. Hell that was tasty!!!

Bruschetta - A tad tangy yet flavorful. Unlike other Italian places where the underlying bread gets soggy after a few minutes, this one sustained for more than 15 mins. Quite an achievement.

Calamari with baby octopus - Fried crunchy goodness! Must order.

Chefs special Risotto with Shrimp and Scallops - Freaking awesomeness!!! Just the right amount of creamy! Nothing too overwhelming. Pesto added a nice touch to the overall dish. Highly recommended.

Tiramisu - Disclaimer : If you serve me a decent Tiramisu, you can trick me into giving you a 5 star rating. Alas it's true for this place. Loved the interplay of Coffee, Rum and Mascarpone cheese!

"I was in the area and was looking for a quick lunch, so I stopped by. Mama Cho's BBQ is located in the Lake Chabot Public Market, so make sure you don't drive past it like I almost did!
I ordered the Rice Plate (~$12) which comes with rice, 2 meats, kimchi, broccoli, and bean sprouts. To be honest, the plate is already on the pricier side but to get specific meats, you have to pay more. The only meats included in the price were the chicken and pork. I got the Chicken but the other meat I got was the Beef Bulgogi. This was an additional $2.
The meats were the best part of the meal. It went well with the rice which was just standard white rice. The broccoli was fine but the bean sprouts and kimchi didn't seem fresh to me. The kimchi was particularly pungent, but I'm typically not a fan of kimchi, in general, so maybe I should have asked if they could swap it with anything else.
Overall, I paid ~$16 for this meal and for an average rice plate like this, it's not worth the money. I don't think I'd come back here.",4,0,1,1,1

"I can't believe I haven't written a review for my favorite Korean restaurant in the area. I've been coming here for almost 3 years since I moved to Concord from LA where I had the luxury of being close to Ktown. I also come here a lot because I keep craving Korean food ever since I visited South Korea.
Let me start by saying that they have the best mul naengmyeon in the area. The cold noodles have the best ""chewiness"" among the ones I've tried around here. I wish there's more crushed ice in the broth, but it has very good flavor and I'm glad I can get good naengmyeon here (don't forget to add vinegar and mustard!). It goes so well with any grilled meat they offer like samgyupsal, galbi, or spicy pork bulgogi.
They serve some traditional Korean food that you can find in other restaurants and some that you can only find here. The food is generally executed here very well compared to other restaurants in the area. 
Their kimchi jjigae has good kimchi flavor and warms you up on a cold day. Another favorite is the yukgaejang/spicy beef soup with noodles. 
The dumpling and rice cake soup is very simple but delicious.
Their kimchi pancake is most of the times fluffy and crispy but we've also had it sometimes when it's not as crispy. 
Their stir fried gopchang (intestines) has good flavor, clean tasting, and cooked well. The army stew and gamjatang are perfect to share with 2 or more people.
The banchan can be really good but sometimes the flavor is just ok.
There's still a lot in their menu that I want to try. The service is great and I'll definitely keep coming back.",5,0,2,1,1
"Ajisen is one of my favorite ramen places. EVER. All the ramen that they offer are cheaper than most ramen places. The prices and taste of the ramen are consistent. Portion wise, they give are just enough to fill you up. Service was great! Waiters/waitresses were attentive and friendly and kept checking up on us to see if we needed anything. The food came out quick as well (within 5-10 minutes after we had ordered)!

Noodles are chewy and goes well with the broth. Broth was really fatty and rich. The broth itself tasted similar to the premium pork ramen as well. But the BBQ pork slices that were given are plentiful. They gave me at least 5 slices of pork in my ramen! The photos on the menu do not deceive you folks! What you see on the menu is what you'll get. 

I would honestly come here everyday if I lived closer to it because of how cheap it is. Don't miss out on it!",5,0,2,2,1

"What do I love? Delicious Mexican food! And, Salsa Verde Mexican DELIVERS, mmkay? Hella bomb ass Mexican food all the way in the cuts of Concord. Yes, I said in the cuts because it's hidden on some random industrial style road, but apparently, that ain't stopping nobody else from coming here. And since it's randomly located, there's enough street parking to keep everyone happy.

Came here one day craving for some authentic Mexican eats, and that's exactly what I got! I must first mention how stinkin' CUTE this place looks! When you first pull up, you might think that you've arrived at someone's residence until you see their sign on the building! The exterior looks like a cute old house! The interior reminds me of a grandma's dining room, but not in a bad way. The table cloths are so damn adorable and the entire place has such a homey feel to it. When you walk in, you'll order at the counter and they'll bring your food out to your table.

I was in a seafood mood (but then again, when am I NOT in a seafood mood?) and decided to order their camarones al mojo de ajo aka garlic shrimp entree. DAMN was that sucker good! They blessed me with a generous portion of juicily plump and flavorful shrimp alongside the most authentic tasting rice and homemade refried beans! It. Was. Heaven. HEAVEN! Portions were so large that ended up taking a doggie bag with me to go. Their homemade flour tortillas were the perfect additive to this already perfect dish!

And, let's not forget to mention that horchata and those super tasty complimentary chips and salsa! YAAASSS! YAS to it ALL! The horchata was delicious and their chips and salsa were even more amazing at that. Fresh made chips and really yummy salsa with a nice kick. The only nitpick would be to lessen the amount of salt on those chips because with that kind of salsa, it really didn't need it. 

Service was excellent! It's a family owned business and everyone that I encountered was extremely friendly and seems excited to be there. They also have a TV in their lobby and they were playing the Warriors game while I was there. Extra cool points awarded for that! Bottom line is, you need to stop here if you're having a craving for some delicious Mexican cuisine! Salsa Verde Mexican will be sure to not disappoint!",5,17,27,25,1
"Really chill, unpretentious vibe. Ridiculously extensive menu of not only Trappist ales but about 30 pages worth of other Belgian-style ales.

I will definitely be going back whenever I'm in San Francisco.",5,0,0,1,1
"This is probably the best Pho place I've gone to. The waiter was very kind and welcoming and even offered to help me take a picture with my family. The food is MSG free and yet still delicious . Eventhough the outside makes the resturant look dirty, the inside is very clean and tidy. Conveniently, there is market right next door so when we finished the meal we went grocery shopping!!. The parking is limited but restaurant doesn't have any wait line! Their noodles offered 2 different size and large variety options. We tried number 11 with the ox tail, and the garlic noodles with boneless pork chops.",5,0,0,0,1
"My first time here. My daughter recommended the Miso Deluxe Ramen bowl and it did not disappoint. It had an assortment of seafood such as, shrimp, baby clams & small scallops. The broth was packed with flavor and the small pieces of smoked pork belly were delicious.

The restaurant is small and there was a wait time of about 10 minutes. My daughter is a regular her and states that wait times can be as long as an hour or more on particular days.
Staff was friendly and very accommodating. I couldn't make up my mind between the Miso or cream based broths so the waitress brought me a sample of both. They were both great! Really hard decision but ultimately I chose Miso. Next time(and there will be a next time) I will try the cream based broth.",5,0,0,1,1
"So good! Fieldwork IPA on tap, lovingly prepared salads, a small but wide ranging menu and great service and setting make this little neighborhood spot a winner before even considering the pie. The typical El Cerrito / Berkeley family vibe is present, but well accommodated. You can still feel like you're having a special, if not romantic dining experience. They have Straus soft-serve ice cream and make a great sundae too! 

The pizza is sublime. Crust is bread and Chef is an amazing baker. With a wood fired oven and perfect dough, the crust is stretchy, crusty and tender. Salted and topped with gourmet ingredients it is pizza to die for! Our favorite is the fried sage, but anything with tomato sauce is delicious also. Legitimate 'last meal' level pizza. The kind of pie you can dream about and lust for weeks after or before going. 

Thank you Benchmark! Bravo!",5,0,1,1,1
"Despite the weird name and interesting entrance this is actually a pretty good restaurant. I say that because the name reminds me of stews from parks and rec. Like who wants to go to a place called Stone stew? Doesn't sound very appetizing. From the exterior this place is a market. I came with a friend and we are meeting other friends who had been there before, it was hard to find because we really weren't expecting an exterior like that. It's a very average Middle Eastern grocery store from the outside. However we met our friends and entered with them. When we found was a gorgeous Persian interior. I can't imagine how much more business these guys would make if they had an entrance that was separate and suited the interior of the restaurant.

Anyway beyond my business advice, this restaurant is good. We came with two kids they were very hungry and the staff was kind enough to keep refilling the bread and butter, as well as the water. Despite the fact that it's a fancy looking joint no one was bothered by our kids and they actually found a good time playing on the couch/bed like things in the back. My godson found a toy car on the ground and asked one of the staff he could have it and he said yes. So not sure if they would like in a restaurant to be not as good for kids, but I thought they were very nice. I was craving meat so I went for the two skewer kobideh (sp?) With rice. It was $13.99 and the portion was substantial. I didn't only one star because I felt like the meat could've been a little better spiced and flavored.


Also I feel like it's worth mentioning that the bathroom was surprisingly nice and clean for being part of a random middle eastern market!",4,1,2,0,1
"Such a cute old school spot! Just imagine just classic burgers and shakes. Nothing fancy or hipster. My boyfriend came here when he was little and so did his parents. Definitely a staple of Hayward. Would highly recommend checking out and maybe taking some cute milkshakes pictures! :)

I ordered the ""baby burger"" and my boyfriend ordered the ""mama burger"". We got an order of fries to share (they come in a big basket so definitely more than enough to share) and a strawberry milkshake (also enough to share, they give you the metal cup that the shake was made in). Everything was very classic and delicious. Service was great and the table was filled with condiments & toppings that you can add to your burger.",5,4,5,5,1

"Polarizing reviews usually means one of the two things, high variance in service quality or the authenticity of flavor that doesn't fit westernized taste test. In this case, I have been to this place 4 times now, there was low variance in the food I was served, and looking through the 2/3 star reviews, it became clear that one's delights might not always be another's pearls ;)

The food here tend to be of smaller portions, sweeter, and some dishes might not have such a strong flavor, but it does often provide a more authentic Shanghai home cuisine experience, so if these are down your alley, you'd certainly enjoy it!",5,1,3,0,1
"For a group of 4 on Sunday at 4:45pm, we waited 20-30 min. The seating is limited so I'd advise to go with small parties (less than 4 people). 

I ordered: American Kobe Beef Premium Wagyu, Sumo size ($29.99): Kobe beef, house special/garlic miso broth, veggie plate, mixed grain rice. High quality meat! Slices are not thin like typical ayce shabu meat. The Kobe almost melted in your mouth (I say almost because they also offer A4 Miyazaki wagyu which I have to come back for). Totally delicious and very filling. Sumo is a lot of food haha! I prefer the garlic miso broth over the house special (soy milk + miso) as it gave the meat more flavor. The veggie plate has a nice variety; I did think the tomatoes were kind of weird in it though....as for the sauces, both the goma and the ponzu were delicious! I love that they offer the mixed grain rice as well. 

Creekstone Premium Black Angus Ribeye, Sumo size ($30.99): also very delicious. There's not as much marbling as the wagyu but still drool worthy.

Top quality shabu! If I was in the area, I'd be here often forsure.",5,1,1,2,1
"This place is super popular, thank god for Yelp mobile check in. We checked in around 5:30p and got seated right before 7pm.

The overall experience was great, however we would probably not come back again.

The service was great, every server was nice and attentive; from changing out the grill plate and to see if you would like to order more.

It's AYCE, you are allowed to order 10 plates at a time (from menu of 100 items from meat, veggies, meatballs, to dim sum) at a time. The portion for each dish is small which is great so you can taste what you like and order more. Another great thing is everyone get to have their own pot of soup.

The food is ok/average. The dim sum is also just ok, nothing to brag about.

For $30 per person for our family of 4 was $120 + tips. Normal hotpot place (we love Little Sheep) our bill is usually around or less than $100 (include tips) and we get to bring the leftover soup home, and we have more than enough food. Although would not want to bring this soup home...

When it comes to the soup/broth, this place's broth is drench with MSG, my tongue was so uncomfortably all night. Not a big deal if you are used to it.

It was a good try but that's about it. I guess if you are a big eater and want to get your money's worth, this place is not a bad option.",4,0,0,0,1
"Oh.
My.
Heavens.
I'm left wondering why people aren't shouting about this place from the rooftops. This meal was *so* delicious. Got the Brussels sprouts, which were sweet and succulent and crispy and absolutely the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had, hands down. We also got the Neon Chicken, and the chicken was so tender and buttery it just melted in your mouth, and was on top of a bed of rice that was caramelized and a bit crispy. The cauliflower dish we got was also crazy flavorful and original, and the beet salad was so fresh and tasty we ate every last piece of leaf and I was tempted to lick the dressing off the plate.
I was told to try The Slanted Door in City Center and I found it totally disappointing and overpriced - The Salt was 1,000 times better and so much more interesting and filling. Each dish had so many flavors packed into it that were a combination of things I'd never think to try together but worked absolutely perfectly. Next time I have a visitor from out of town I can't wait to bring them here!",5,1,1,1,1

"This review is a review on the Grub Hub delivery and also the food. Delivery was surprisingly fast! The food was good too but I felt the noodles were overcooked. If you like spicy food you should get it ""Thai Spicy."" ""Spicy"" was just mild. The food was more like a 3 or 3.5.",4,0,0,0,1
"The four stars are for KEN L, the young man who seated us, took our order, made our drinks and served our food. He was doing everything! The restaurant wasn't busy but still, to have one person doing it all while the manager or whoever she was just sitting at the bar talking to the oyster guy, is ridiculous. We even heard other customers complimenting him on his hustle.

Onto the food ...
Calamari was over breaded and crunchy. The calamari inside was chewy & dry.
My husband had the cioppino. He said it was okay but he's had better. It wasn't as hearty as he's used to. He kept running his fork through it to show how much wasn't on the fork.
I had the oven roasted chicken and vegetables. We both liked it a lot. It was very flavorful & juicy.

We went during happy hour but there isn't a printed happy hour menu because it changes daily(?) We were given a hand printed list but he wasn't sure how much items were. 

Everything was pretty pricey for the quality and portion size. The place is nice and closer to home but we've tried it once and probably won't be coming back.",4,1,4,1,1
"This place is a bit on the pricier side but it may be definitely worth it. We ordered the house special soup. The soup was spicy but had lots of flavor and definitely not healthy! We ordered Angus beef, chicken, and tendon. The tendon was great absorbing all that soup flavor. We also got instant noodle to get the most of the soup. Overall great experience but had to wait really long for our check which was the only downer.",4,0,1,0,1

"Food:

#1 Roll - Refreshing cause of the Yuzu and the spiciness adds a nice kick! ($13.95)

Christopher Roll - it's spicy and the it's topped with crab. It has both tuna and salmon. I thought it was a bit drier than I'd like it to be but still good ($14.95)

Green tea ice cream: each person gets a free scoop of green tea ice cream. It's a smoother silkier ice cream. Pretty good. 

Edamame - they give this for free as an appetizer. These tastes well!

"This is the freshest fish and tuna poke on par with Maui. Best fish and chips, fish tacos are amazing. Second time here in two days. You just can't get this stuff in NY. 

Burritos, tacos, sandwiches and fish and chips made with the fish of the day or choose from the fish on the boards. Rockfish was the fish o the day and it was nicely seasoned, grilled perfectly and you get a large portion on two tacos. The toppings taste just picked fresh. 


They also had salmon, black cod, sole, halibut. They even name the boats and how it was caught. 

Fish and chips was tender, crispy perfect batter and chips right on point. 

Tuna Poke was so fresh you could cut the big pieces you get with a tortilla chip. Melt in your mouth. Wonderful sauce. Get Guac with it for a nice appetizer. 

The crab cakes were small but delicious. I generally do not like dill but this was so fresh and just right. Again amazing. 

There is always a line. Limited seating inside some outside and NO parking. Locals are parking here so none for this shop. You get someone to watch the car you parked in front of a garage every so often. No one seemed upset and many others pulled up to get an order. You get the order fast and take it to the beach or eat on top of Lands End. That's the finest spot to eat anyway. 

Simply amazing. I'd be here every other day if I lived here.",5,0,3,0,1

I would recommend:

Falafel (anything): A really nice flavor and texture. Heart-shaped is a nice touch.

Chicken Shawarma and Beef Gyro plates with salad: Both are plentiful and filling. The meat is alright, but the salads come with a lot of different ingredients that have been flavored such as olives, jalapenos (pickled), fresh tomatoes, lettuce etc...

Hummus!! *free add-on: Probably one of the better hummuses I have ever had. Usually not a huge fan of hummus, but I could probably eat this all day. Fresh, flavorful, a nice texture. I'd definitely say this was a highlight of the meal.

Quantity: Average-A lot

Service 
Great service, knowledgable staff. There's a lot of communication, which is probably why the line goes so quick. It makes for a very smooth experience.

"We saw this on the PBS TV show, Check Please Bay Area, some time ago and wanted it check it out if we were ever in that area. We finally made it.

What we didn't realize was that this place is located in the middle of an Industrial Park and it was a Saturday night so it was very quiet - most likely much quieter than normal. And I'd bet they are mobbed at every lunch period during the work week. It's also very small inside but they more than doubled their capacity with a large outdoor patio area. It's not fancy at all - something that you would expect from a business that caters to the workers in an industrial zone. But, it's nice enough.

We were with another couple. We started with an order of Grilled Octopus and an order of French Fries - both excellent. I had the Pastichio, Greek style baked macaroni with beef. My wife had the Moussaka. Our friends had the Grilled Sausage (Anise flavor) and a Vegetarian Vegetable Platter. It was all outstandingly good. Couple this along with the large portions, moderate prices and competent, friendly service and this place all adds up to be a real winner. They even 'comped' us with 4 Flan desserts!

"Stopped in for a pink chai on my drive back to San Jose. It was an off one stop off I wasn't sure of but found myself wondering when and how I could come back for my next cup before I even finished my first. 

I've had many a cup of chai. Overpriced, under spiced, artisanal, Starbucks, local. You name it, I probably already have a strong opinion about how good it is. 

I fall short of words to describe the warm and fuzzy goodness in this cup of pink chai. Drinking this cup felt like a hug. A real hug. The kind that washes your body with relief and comfort. Thats this cup of chai in every sip. What do they put in it!! 

Coffee shop is a good size with 4 two tops and two large seating areas great for groups. They also have counter and one little chair tucked away in the corner for the more solitary coffee drinker. They also have outdoor seating. Was very comfortable drinking my chai. Didn't feel rushed or like I was taking up space. Really relaxed vibes here.

"Pros: 

- Great tasting food 
- Reasonable pricing 
- Good customer service 
- Aesthetic, minimal decor 
- Decent menu variety 

Cons: 

- Small waiting area 

Overall: 
Came here as a party of 4 on a busy weekend and waited ~30-45 minutes but it was worth the wait! It was a chilly day out and hot pot really hit the spot. We ordered 3 different soups: Thai, Milk Curry, and the House special. All of them were super flavorful, well seasoned, and had a variety of toppings including tofu, fish balls, cabbage, mushroom, pork, etc. You can customize the spice level for the soups and each came with a serving of rice. The proportions are pretty big if you don't have a large appetite so I'd recommend sharing a pot for two! You can take home leftovers though so no worries. The waiter was really nice and we got free samples of lemonade afterwards. I'd say it was a pretty nice dinner and I'll definitely come back in the future! The only downside is that the waiting area inside is quite small as there's also a tea bar inside which takes up a lot of space.",5,0,0,1,1

I ordered my staples; an overkill of basil shrimp rice minus the egg and the basil shrimp with green beans. Like I say over and over, I'm one to order my favorite dish in order for me to really give an honest opinion. 

First to mention is their service. Before I placed an order her service is mentionable. She made sure my water cup was never empty. Next to mention is the food. Quickly after ordering was as quick as it came out. First the rice was brought out. Delish where I was equally excited for the main course to come.

"This was my first visit to Bask. My bf had made a reservation for Valentine's Day, as expected the whole restaurant was bustling w/ guests but we got seated fairly quickly. 

Food: We ordered
1. Iberico Ham (10/10): This appetizer was absolutely DIVINE. The dish cost around $25 and came w several slices of ham and a delicious sort of bruschetta. My bf and I devoured this in 2 seconds and we were absolutely devastated it was gone so soon. We will be back even if it's just to get this appetizer!! 

2. Bone Marrow (5/10): The bone marrow was our least favorite dish of the night, but nonetheless pretty tasty. Bone marrow in general is not a filling dish and this one was only around $15, but we thought that it could've used a little more seasoning. This tapas came with 2 huge pieces of bone marrow and 4 pieces of toasted bread. The bread was a little over toasted. Probably will not get this one again as there are so many other tapas to try! 

3. Paella Royale (8/10): The paella royale was pretty scrumptious. It came with some prawns, mussels, clams, calamari, and chicken. All of the seafood and meat were cooked just right. The only down side to this dish was the wait time and the portion size. This dish cost around $35 and we were a little bit disappointed by the small size. We've gotten paella at other Spanish restaurants around the city that cost pretty much the same, but this was by far the smallest portion. To make up for the crazy wait time(50+ minutes), our waitress was sweet enough to give us some wine on the house. 

All in all my bf and I had an amazing experience at Bask and we will be back!",5,0,1,0,1
"came here for late supper with my family. ambience is just ok. service is not bad. ordered stir fry string beans with garlic sauce. they mixed it with yellow onion and taste is so perfect. i bet they did not cook only with garlic but they mixed it with something else and made the taste so great!!! and ordered combination crispy noodle - oh my god, the portion was huge. i expected they use bigger noodle instead of small one and put mixed vegetables instead of pak choi only. the pan fried rice rolls with xo sauce was a bit salty.

As with most other poke places, Poke Don is a line system where you pick your bases, then your proteins, sauces, toppings, and extras. I'm a fan of the salmon with the ponzu and house soy sauces over greens, and for toppings the free seaweed salad and marinated mushrooms are really good, and I like getting sesame seeds or furikake too. 

Poke don's usually packed around lunchtime with many people having to go orders, so keep that in mind when planning to go. Parking's plentiful.",4,0,1,0,1

"It's Hatcho ordinary Japanese food! (I'll show myself out.)

Read all the reviews and the sign at the front warning about the wait times, and the woman who seated us also asked if we had a lot of time because it was busy. But I didn't think the wait was so bad.

There's several private rooms so even if it looks empty it might be busy. If there are loads of shoes everywhere but it's quiet and you don't see a lot of people, you can still assume there is at least one person per pair of shoes, duh. When we were there there were only 7 people we could see in the front, but tons of shoes. Even so, ordering and eating 6 dishes took 2 people less than 90 minutes, not the 2 hours others mentioned. We also didn't smell mold, as one Yelper said.

Don't get the sushi. The cooked food was fine but the sushi was subpar even for the Bay area (why a place so close to ocean has such a plethora of bad sushi and seafood I will never understand).

Lazy spicy tuna roll. It was like a tekka maki with sriracha squirted on top of the pieces. The fish on the sushi was chewy and fishy. The amount of wasabi on each piece of nigiri was criminal. The miso soup was fine, nothing special.

The best thing was their shake ochazuke. The fish is raw and they pour the tea over it, cooking it at your table. They have you layer the nori, raw salmon, puffed millet, and unagi sauce with sesame seeds over the rice, then they pour tea over it and add soy sauce to taste. This was interactive and fun, and the light poaching of the salmon was tastier than the raw sashimi was and tastier than overcooked salmon would have been. Also the unagi sauce was the mildest I'd ever had, which imho is a good thing since I hate overly sweet food but ymmv. It was kind of salty so we drank a lot of water and tea to compensate, leaving us feeling a bit sloshy inside by the end of the meal. This is their specialty and probably the best dish.

The grilled toro (fatty tuna) over rice was not bad, though I was not expecting this to come over cold sushi rice like chirashi, as it was grilled and not raw. I am torn about blowtorch-seared food in general because torching the fat makes for a very unctuous piece of flesh, but I don't care for the gasoline-y aftertaste the blowtorch imparts. This also came with miso, so we were pretty souped and tea'd out by the end.

So of course we had ordered another soupy item, the matsutake mushroom udon. The matsutake was a little too strong for me and was filled with more fish cake than mushroom. I prefer making matsutake dishes at home with fresh matsutake from Nijiya. It comes out a lot less strong at home for some reason. Maybe they use dried mushroom here? Even though matsutake is a seasonal item there was no mention of being seasonal, despite the tempura uni being marked as seasonal.

Speaking of tempura uni, we got that too. It was agedashi tofu like, soaked in tempura sauce with grated daikon. Its price is whited out on the menu but we were warned it was going to be $40 when we ordered. I liked this but the sauce made the tempura kind of pointless because it was soggy. This is better at Maruhisa (?) In Costa Mesa, where they serve it plain and crispy. I'd like a hybrid of both, plain and crispy with the sauce on the side for dipping.

And as if that weren't a ton of food already, we also got the chicken tempura, which tasted a lot like the karaage at Yayoi.

We ended up taking the chicken and extra sushi rice home but got shamed by the hostess for eating all that food. Yeah, we're pigs, and that was our only meal all day long. What of it? )-o-( (Yelp won't let me make my usual Jigglypuff face of indignation emoji.)

I will say they had some Osakan specialties like kushikatsu (aka tonkatsu on a stick) that we didn't feel needed to be tried, as we've had them in Hawaii and it's pretty much just katsu. Would not have been against it though, and might try if we come back.

Overall, it was really uneven. If we had just had sushi we probably would've landed on a 2, and that would have been a pity 2 for a family business. If we had had just the ochazuke, toro, uni, and chicken, it would have probably been a 5. I'm thinking 3.5 but as they're a small one-off family business they can have a 4. But not for the sushi.",4,1,1,0,1

The tacos themselves were great - the meat was cooked wonderfully and was bountifully places on each taco. the salsa in each taco paired perfectly and were super tasty.

1. Fried chicken, Mac and cheese & collard greens. 
2. Combo fried fish & chicken, mac & cheese & collard greens

The Fried chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The batter for the fry is super delicious, its subtle not too powerful. 

Mac n Cheese, has a different flair to it but delicious! I like how the swirly pasta is incorporated with the mac and cheese. Maybe its just me but I do not like too much cheese in my mac, I prefer a good ratio and this hits the spot.

Collard greens was not too salty so that's plus in my book. Everywhere else I had it, has always been really salty.

 TIP: Order out. There are only 2 tables inside. It's a small quaint place but not large enough to have a sit down dinner

"Burgerim is a fast-growing gourmet burger chain that seems to be popping up everywhere! They specialize in mix-and-match burgers where you pick the protein and toppings. You can opt for a single, 4-oz or 8-oz burger,
or get more small burgers that are 3-oz each. You can get a duo, trio, and up to a party tray of 16 mini burgers!

Being my first time, I picked a trio of Angus Beef, Lamb, and Grilled Chicken burgers. Angus Beef was very juicy (5 stars), although the lamb was more bland (3 stars). Grilled Chicken was thick but moist and juicy (4 stars). A combo with drink and hot and crispy sweet potato fries (5 stars) cost $18. A fairly pricey lunch, but I was with my work buddy who comes back to Cali every other month. So its okay to splurge!

My buddy went all beef with Wagyu and Angus burgers. He mentioned he could taste the difference and noted the Wagyu was far juicier. Its worth the $0.99 upgrade. His regular fries were also disk-shaped, as if sliced by a mandolin and fried perfectly. I love these fries!

They have a high-tech soda fountain that also works with the Freestyle App. My buddy programmed a custom blend of three diet sodas, scanned the QR code, and out came the drink. Cool and gimmicky but I'll stick to my Dasani Lime Water. 

Definitely a fan of Burgerim. Its similar in quality to Habit but its also on the pricier side. The variety and customization is great. 4 stars.",4,10,14,12,1

Friendly owners.

Generous banchan. The banchan here is a little different in flavor from usual banchan.
- Japchae- more sesame oil so has a stronger flavor
- Kimchi- sweeter, less vinegary and tart
- Marinated cucumbers- smoky flavor
- Marinated soybeans- standard
- Fishcakes- standard flavor, fishcakes are thin, kind of like tofu skin texture
They asked us 3x if we wanted refills, which is definitely something I'm not accustomed to.

We ordered the Large 2 which came with wings and drum sticks 2 rice and 2 salads. The drumsticks were huge and so were the wings these definitely weren't your wingsstop style wings.

"Fashion Wok is a popular individual hot pot restaurant located in Foster City. For their second location, they've chosen a prime and spacious downtown Sunnyvale destination and launched with a competitive soft opening menu. 

For both lunch and dinner, individual hot pots are discounted to $9.99 for lunch and $10.99 for dinner. The menu features a variety of hot pot styles with popular versions being their Taiwanese, stinky tofu and Korean army stew. A few hot pots are pricier, including their seafood hot pot, and are not discounted during the soft opening. Besides hot pot, the menu also includes noodles and rice dishes although not all items are available yet. 

Given the competitive pricing (I've spent $15-20 for individual hot pot), Fashion Wok was quite crowded. There are plentiful servers but they're understandably busy. It took me a few minutes to be seated and even longer for my order to be taken. There was also a wait for the order (over 15 min) and I had to remind a waiter. My order:

Fashion Wok - $9.99. Their namesake hot pot included a bone broth like white broth that was savory but not particularly notable. A hodgepodge of items including beef, pork, shrimp, fish balls, meatballs, tofu, fish tofu and more are included. While the ingredients are solid, the highlight definitely is the quantity. The sauces (chili oil, hot garlic sauce, garlic sauce, peanut sauce) are solid as well and I particularly liked the garlic sauce. 

Overall, I was happy to finally try Fashion Wok. Tasty Pot and Boiling Pot seem to be leading the pack but most hot pot places are similar. The distinguishing factor are either old school places (Little Saigon) or the price and the opening prices here are noteworthy. 

Fashion Wok accepts credit cards including American Express.",4,7,17,11,1

Ordered apps since it was still happy hour (not sure what time it started and we didn't even know they had one!!! I'll have to double check), but it was half off apps I believe and there was some discounts on drinks. 

We ordered the Blue Line Pizza deep dish, Aphrodite with gluten free crust (only comes in small) and a large tipsy pig with thin crust.

Everything was perfect but I do have minus one star for the crust, I had no idea it was like cornbread/cornmeal and I totally thought it was odd and lacked a lot of flavor. Yes, I added honey onto it but crusts are usually my favorite part of pizzas and I didn't enjoy the one they had!

Cheese is made of 2 kinds; there's also classic red bean and vanilla cream +25 cents. Green tea and black sesame are barely sweet! No guilt & they're baked.

On to the popular rice dogs. I opted for the plain mozzarella my first visit, since Myunggrang's combo at H Mart left me hanging with 1/2 sausage at the bottom. The cheese pull is real! Everyone's photos online looked amazing! I actually got tired of too much cheese haha so next time I got the stacked 1/2 & 1/2 with Hebrew beef sausage at the bottom, added potato crust for $1! I asked for no sugar both times since one review persuaded me to ""listen to my gut"" and get none. The rice flour gives a nice chewy crunch! The potato crust makes the hot dog massive, just saying! Tastes like French fries =) so many sauces to choose from! I liked the wasabi mayo, not spicy. 

*2 kiosk tablets available to order from if the main line is long OR you'd rather avoid social interaction.
Also learned you can get light or extra sugar on rice dogs.

Their japchae isn't the best I've had but it's still good! $5 for a small bowl (a bit overpriced compared to Sorabol).

Cup combo has a bit of everything. $15 for spicy rice cakes, kimchi fried rice +$1.50 for fried egg, japchae, and oden (fishcake skewer in soy-dashi broth). Fried rice was spicy, rice cakes were ok. My Mom really likes the oden.

Yubu chobap! Tofu skin rice rolls. Think Japanese sweetened fried tofu nigiri but with purple rice instead, danmuji (pickled yellow radish) on the side. Pretty good! And it's cold, so great for a warm day! 7 pieces for $9.50, or $12 when bundled with oden.

I heard about this place, but I didn't get the chance to go until this day when the weather was nice.

The interior was nicely decorated, as the staff greeted me. After a brief look at the menu, I ordered the Grapefruit Happiness with Rainbow Jelly.

As I waited for my drink, I looked over the layout of the store. Then the owner (?) offered me a sample of their Strawberry Milk Tea which they were adding to the menu. It was good.

I got my drink, and it was tasty and refreshing. This place offers classes, including a Mochi making one. I'll have to visit again soon.",5,0,1,1,1
"Souvla is the best restaurant in SF, hands down. It is consistently busy, and for good reason. 

Things that I love: You order at the counter and they bring your food out to the table. It comes super quick, too! The menu online shows calories - everything is healthy AND delicious. The menu might be limited, but they serve wine, beer, french fries, frozen yogurt... what more could you want? There is nice outdoor seating. The list goes on! 

As far as the food goes, order the salads! I could seriously eat the pork salad for every meal. It's really delicious and a perfect size. The lamb salad is excellent as well. Don't forget to order a frozen Greek yogurt with baklava to go!",5,0,1,2,1

Broth: on point. It was hot, spicy, and flavorful. It wasn't super oily like a lot of other places (you know, that leave a layer of fat on your mouth type of film which could have easily been fixed if they had skimmed the fat layer appropriately)
Noodle: just enough bite.
Toppings: pretty sure they forgot to put the bamboo shoots and mushrooms on mine. Boiled egg was delicious.

So delicious but I don't see how anyone can mess up putting fish eggs on rice

"Amazing experience every time I come here! The stuffed angel wings is something new I've never tried before, it was so good! It was like a combination of veggie and glass noodles stuffed inside of a chicken, amazing appetizer if you've never tried it.

The Kao Poon is a favorite of mine, it's always my go to. I like to get it with egg noodles because the chewy texture really balances out the other toppings and soaks in the flavored, creamy broth well. The chicken satay is a really great, go to appetizer as well. The chicken is crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside.",5,2,1,4,1
"This is not your traditional Mexican restaurant!! Love eating LOCAL! Supporting my community!! 

Cocina Hermanas food was tasty and great! Kudos to Chef and Sous Chefs! A few hiccups in service (very crowded) but overall great! Of course there are improvements to be made but they are a new restaurant, so I'm trying to be lenient because this foodie ELITE YELPER loved their menu! So different! 

There were 6 of us sampling everything we could from their unique menu and we were all pleasantly surprised! So many choices: Totopos: Queso Fundido! A MUST! Add Chorizo and be amazed! Table Salsa and chips were fresh and great too! 
Mahi Mahi and Shrimp dishes were incredible! Enchiladas with Chicken and Pork great! Trio of Carnitas and Fish great! Crab and Shrimp Flautas were also amazing! All great!

"Mmm, crawfish. Mmmm, shrimp. MMMM snow crab legs!! - basically me reading the menu at Boiling Crab. 

To really enjoy eating at Boiling Crab you must: 1) be willing to get down and dirty and eat with your hands, 2) handle spice, 3) love seafood because there are basically no other entree options, and 4) have short nails unless you're cool with having them smell like Cajun for a few days because they DON'T offer plastic gloves. 

Oh, and don't wear white!!! You get a plastic bib, but your sleeves are still exposed to the splash zone created by you furiously shelling juicy shrimp and crawfish and getting that delicious spicy goodness into your mouth. 

We ordered two pounds of the snow crab legs (market price today was $18/lb) and added corn to our bags. YUM. We also got an appetizer of sweet potato fries which were super yummy. 

I just wish the seafood came with more sauce. Some other places I've been (like in SoCal) served it literally drowning in sauce, but here at Boiling Crab it was enough to coat the food and leave just enough to dip after shelling. We had to scoop and rub the sauce into the corn too. They do charge five bucks or so for the Extra Saucy option, but it really should come standard...",4,0,1,0,1
"This place is so cool! 
The ambiance, the staff, the food ... 

We came here on a Sunday night and the place was pretty empty - why? I don't get why this place isn't packed! I mean, I like the fact that we walked in and was seated right away and that our food was out in a jif; but really, guys ... this place should be super packed. 

They have a full bar, modern decor, is super spacious, and offer vegan options - and I'm not talking just veggies my friends ... I'm talkin vegan cheese and vegan sausage! And their crust is vegan - they use olive oil; no butter, no honey. SCORE! 

The moment I walked in my event planner mind was churning! There's a section of the restaurant that you can easily rope off and reserve for a private event... 

Now on to the food .... 

Their bruschetta is SUPER garlicky - which I LOVE - so beware if you're not a garlic fan, or if you're on a date or about to speak to a bunch of folks haha!

We ordered 2 vegan pizzas. Both with their vegan sausage, vegan cheese (I think it's Daiya cheese), mushrooms and olives (mmmm I'm salivating just writing this! Lol) 

Their pizzas are baked in wooden ovens which gives their crust that perfect pizza crust char, and the pizza was super delicious!

"We dined here many times even when it was Cafe primavera. Since the change to Sienna bistro, we've been patrons of Sienna Bistro several times the past 4yrs. 
Last nights experience:
We were promptly seated and greeted by the same friendly lady that's always there. 
They accommodated our reservation quite nicely with a wonderful table per my request.
I ordered the saut�����ed Scalone for the 4th time or so.
My other half ordered the Mediterranean seafood pasta entree of the evening.
The service was fast and courteous.
The seafood pasta was quite flavorful. Could use more seafood. Mostly pasta (see pic below)
The scalone was not as good as I recall until I got home and found a previous food pic i posted here.. I realised it's missing the sauce!

"A hidden little gem in Hollister. 

The food here is Brilliant. The owner Mike Fisher is very hands on and absolutely passionate about his craft. The moment we stepped in through the door, Mike welcomed us in, and briefly had a chat with us...mostly wine talk. Fisher's was highly recommended by the staff DeRose Vineyards and at Calera as well. They did mention he had a stint at Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Academy in France. We might have gone wine tasting before we came here ;-) 

On to the food stuff...but first some more wine. We heard Fisher's had the DeRose Cab Franc on tap...while that is generally true, they ran out of it that day :-( Mike apologized and mentioned that he stopped by DeRose earlier in the morning to pick some up, but they weren't open. So, we settled for a glass of the House wine - Fishers Red, Calera Pinot Noir and Calera Chardonnay. 

OK fine...that was more wine talk...now the food stuff:

- Grilled Sweetbreads - For those who aren't all that familiar, these are NOT breads at all...lol. In fact Sweetbreads are the culinary names for the thymus (also called throat, gullet, or neck sweetbread) or the pancreas (also called heart, stomach, or belly sweetbread), especially of calf (ris de veau) and lamb (ris d'agneau), and, less commonly, of beef and pork. Think of these as meat candy, fresh, juicy, moist tender deliciousness.

- French dip - Yum! Can't think of anything bad, just wished it was a tad bigger...but that's just me being a fatty. Loved the au jus sauce. 

- Flat Iron Steak - Perfectly done, just the way we asked for it. The meat was juicy, tender and full of flavor, not drowned in seasoning. The Caesar salad was wonderful as well, fresh, crispy juicy lettuce. 

- Vegetable Sandwich - Brilliant, even though it was not for me. The Hummus inside is just delightful, good size with fresh salad on the side.

The staff was very friendly and the the venue was very clean, still looked fairly new.

Definitely a great spot to get a bite...looking forward to coming back.",4,5,14,9,1
Great location delicious food and very friendly! There are a large variety of hamburgers on the menu but i had a classic burger today with american cheese! It was delicious cooked perfectly and great presentation. The fries have to be ordered on the side they were great especially with the two sauces to dip them in! The garlic one was my favorite!

"My wife and I first learned of this restaurant during the Hollister Beer and Wine Stroll. So last night was our 32 wedding anniversary and we decided to go to Paines for dinner. 
The parking lot was full, we were concerned that we would have a long wait, but most of the patrons were in the bar. We were seated right away.
 
The staff was very friendly. We were seated and handed a menu. When I opened mine, I noticed it was a lunch menu. No servers in the dinning room, so I went to the hostess station to exchange menus. The hostess was very apologetic.

Food:
We ordered saganaki (Greek flaming cheese) as an appetizer. It was very good.
Next my wife and I both got the salad. The lettuce was mainly iceberg, more in lines what I would expect from a lower end restaurant.
My wife ordered the seafood ravioli, they came said they only had the crab raviolis and asked if that was. Ok. My wife said yes. Our entries came, my steak smelled wonderful, and tasted great. Very tender. However the garlic mashed potatoes were flavorless, and the vegetable medley was slightly over cooked.
My wife's ravioli was good. They give you a choice of sauces, marinara, meat, Alfredo. My wife selected the Alfredo and commented that it would have been better with a lighter cream sauce which capers. 
Portions are large.

The employees were all very friendly and helpful, even with it being so busy. I really appreciate that because when other places are super busy, the workers aren't always the most friendly, but they are here!

It was reasonably priced and the food was pretty good. We ordered the omelette with pancetta (forget the name), the french toast sampler, and the famous monte cristo. My favorite thing was the monte cristo, although it was a big on the soggy side, I like them a little crispy. The omelette was my second favorite. It was perfectly cooked, very tasty, and the potatoes that came on the side were so delicious and crunchy. The french toast was just ok - we should've just gotten the classic. I thought it was a bit weird that the french toast was made with the banana bread and cranberry orange. They were also kinda soggy. The original slice was so yummy though!",4,0,0,0,1

My party ordered pani puri (today's special) and it was pretty good, and we also each ordered the chicken tikka meal, the madras curry meal, the palak/lamb meal, and the aloo tikki meal. The lamb was a little too spicy for my friend but she was a trooper and ate the whole thing and enjoyed it. My aloo tikki meal could have came with chutneys (I don't really enjoy the chutneys in the bottle) but overall super flavorful dal and madras curry.

Service is top notch and they will be at your table asking you if you need anything frequently. So if you don't like being asked if everything is OK, then you might want to skip town. It's a Greek restaurant and pretty much everything we ate here was great. From the octopus, lamb chops, filet mignon, orzo, foraged mushrooms, dessert, and cocktails all left a great taste in my mouth. I was pleasantly surprised.

The restaurant is welcoming and colorful; the main room has high ceilings and comfortable lighting. All the staff were friendly for our entire visit. The restaurant is very clean including the restrooms. 

Service begins with papadam and three chutney choices, all of which were flavorful. We ordered three entrees: aloo mutter, eggplant curry, and spinach and cheese. Portion sizes were ample and filling. We also had jasmine rice and naan. I also got to have a Flying Horse lager from India; it's usually impossible to find Indian beers where I live. Prices were typical but worthwhile for the food quality. We probably ended up taking more to-go than we actually ate there. I hope to eat here again!",5,2,6,7,1

-Big T's Seafood Market Bar is the shizzle.

-Their draft beer selection is perfect, since I love IPAs, they have a wide-variety & they serve their beers super-cold in a frozen glass cup too.
-There are TV's all over the place, which is very cool.

I had a mimosa and a coffee, yes I did! I preserved the Dungeness Crab omelette. It was made with egg-whites, filled with real crab and jack cheeses, topped with fresh avocado slices and spinach garnish and served with home style potatoes. Other favorites were Dungeness Crab Avocado Benedict and Lobster spinach Benedict. Our groups shared a bowl of lobster bisque, so creamy and yummy!

We had a little sneak peak taste of their dessert dessert. The apple cranberry crisp. It had apples and cranberries topped with oatmeal crunch...served nice and warm warm!

I try to tell myself that I'll order something different the next time but it's useless, I'm a taco addict. 

If there's any criticism that I can offer is that I wish they had more salsas available. But don't get me wrong, the green tomatillo salsa is perfect for the al pastor tacos, but I prefer a hot red salsa for my asada tacos.",5,0,1,0,1
"I came for lunch with a friend after he recommended me this taqueria. Well, originally he had a vague idea of what the place looked like, since his co-worker took him once. We played the Yelp photos game trying to stir his memory; after some time we decided that the taste of the food, if nothing else, would do so.

We arrived at noon to a fairly, but not completely full establishment. At the counter I ordered a side of chips, salsa, and guacamole ($4) and a carnitas super burrito ($9.34). I paid at the counter, found some seating in a small seating annex adjoining the main building, and awaited my order.

As expected, the chips arrived first. The tortilla chips, which tasted freshly made, seemed light, not at all oily, and unsalted. The salsa here - tomato, onions, and cilantro - possessed a slight bit of heat from the addition of diced Jalapeno. I like the bit of heat; it differentiates it from your ubiquitous salsa dip. The guacamole probably came from some jar, given its extremely pureed consistency.

The burrito itself arrived piping hot ~ 5 minutes after the chips. The carnitas here deserve mention; they possessed a crispy texture, mixing fat, oil, and meat into bite-sized deliciousness.

Most neighborhoods have a taqueria of some sort. This area has one with decent prices and good execution.",4,2,2,2,1

My friends breakfast was alright. They got the loco moco and the regular breakfast.

Mine, on the other hand, was AMAZING. The verde and sour cream covered breakfast burrito (no sausage for me) was honestly so good and fresh. The sauce was perfect. Not too spicy, just delicious!!! 

One thing- the prices are a lot for what you get. The burrito doesn't come with any sides. Everything was just smaller/plainer portions for like $13-16! We also got a little shoved into a corner table that could barely fit four people when there were plenty of bigger tables in the place.

"I don't give many restaurants the full slate of stars, but Benvenuti simply checks off all the boxes if you're looking for a fun vibe Friday night with exceptional cuisine, and service to impress. To be more precise, this was about a 4.65 star experience for me!

We did not have a reservation and were also slightly under-dressed yet they seated us rather quickly. We read some reviews and went with a couple recommendations...

1. Grilled Artichoke appetizer
This was flat out better than you can conjure up in your mind and the real show stopper for me. If you want to know what an evenly cooked artichoke is like, please order this. It's hard to do - usually the leaves are overdone and the heart is undercooked or the whole thing is over cooked if boiled or undercooked if baked. Not sure what their secret is, but they got it figured out. The texture was sturdy enough to dip into the pesto sauce (which was good but is not what makes the dish) yet supple enough to take clean bites and really engage the juices. And it was like this from the outermost leaf to the chokeless heart. I joked with the server, asking how much a refill was. 

2. Roasted Cauliflower 
Also cooked very well but what made this dish stand out was the curry-looking sauce that tasted like a much more subtle and creamy roti-bread dipping sauce. We lapped up the sauce with the fresh baked bread slices. 

3. Casarecce Siciliana 
Well it was going to be hard to follow those two fabulous appetizers, but it was close. Tubes pasta, mushroom, house made fennel sausage with marinara. What stood out here (other than having fun saying this dish 10 times fast) was the spicy sausage - which wasn't that spicy, but had enough heat to be noticed compared to the garden variety sausage pasta dish. It was great that the server checked with me beforehand too - well thought out and simply considerate. If anything, there was probably a tad too much sauce at the end. 

4. Linguine Vongole (clams)
My daughter only allowed me to smell it and take a small sample of noodles and a small clam. I don't blame her - the sultry broth and fresh clams was amazing. A few bites into my own dish, I looked up and all clams had disappeared...

5. Affogato
How could I say ""no"" to dessert. They had a nice presentation bringing out the ice cream in a tall martini-looking glass and a small steel cup of hot espresso and poured it over the ice cream. Coffee beans sprinkled the top of the scoop. Yeah - not many better ways to end a great meal. There was nothing left. 

Last note - this should be a $$$ Reataurant - so don't expect to go on the cheap. Service is outstanding - just the right attentiveness and yes they are good at clearing plates.",5,2,6,3,1

Food: If I could give 6 stars I would! We had the palata with chicken coconut curry, black pepper chicken, pumpkin stew tofu, and garlic noodles with tofu. Everything was delicious it was hard to choose a favorite! (But if I had to it would be a tie with the palata and the garlic noodles). 

Definitely coming back!",5,0,2,1,1
"Good Thali experience at Vishnuji Ki Rasoi. They served Maharashtrian thali. The food tasted so authentic. I like the ambiance.
The only bad part of this restaurant sometimes in rush hour they are not able to properly accommodate the guest, it seems to be understaffed. 
But, apart from that everything is good. You must try this restaurant if you like Maharashtrian food.",4,0,0,0,1

"My friends and I decided to try somewhere new, and College Ave always has a great selection of lesser known venues. A quick glance at Yelpers reviews and photos sold us on making a reservation.

The restaurant is pretty small/narrow, but there's a handful of tables and bar seating. When the restaurant is packed, as it was for us, it did feel a bit small but the staff did their best to get groups in an out as efficiently as possible.

Our server, Johnny, was great and very enthused about the menu. He provided us with some great recommendations, and sold three of us on trying the grilled lamb.

The appetizers came out relatively quickly, given how busy the restaurant was, but the wait for our entrees (from the time our appetizers were finished / taken away) was at least 30 minutes. I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, again as I've noted it was busy, but others should be mindful not to come on an empty stomach.

The wok fried calamari was delicious, and had enough spice for a kick that didn't leave us fighting over the water jug. 

The grilled lamb practically fell off the bone. Medium rare was cooked to perfection, and would be a dish I'd get again.

Why can't I give the review a full 5 stars? Because the lobster stew that one of my friends ordered had a handful of mushrooms in it, which she's allergic to. The menu didn't list mushrooms as an ingredient. We asked another server if we could get another dish made without mushrooms, but were told it would be over 30 minutes. Instead, my friend opted to change entrees with her partner.

Besides that, I would still happily come back.

Tips:

- Make a reservation, especially if you're aiming for the 6:00 pm - 8:30 pm dinner window. I saw quite a few groups of walk ins be turned away due to not enough availability, or an extended wait

- If you're allergic to anything, always ask the server to confirm with the kitchen staff whether or not those items are part of the dish. Not all ingredients may be listed

- Parking : No dedicated parking, but there is a handful of street parking. Just be mindful of any red zones",4,2,1,2,1
"Cilantro Taqueria is proof that there is good Mexican food in The City that's not within a few blocks of Mission Street.

This little cafe is in a hard-to-categorize neighborhood, not exactly North Beach but thankfully not in Fisherman's Wharf. Surrounded by typical SF 3-story residential buildings, Cilantro is a quickie for burritos, nachos, tacos, and Mexican Coke, at a good price.

I expected to find parking on the other side of Columbus Ave. Surprisingly, we snagged a spot on the same block of Mason that Cilantro is on. I knew we were in for a treat when I saw eight Mexican construction workers having lunch. Mexicans don't go to Taco Bell, they prefer the real thing. They also serve Jarritos, so yes, it's authentic.

For $37 (a little more expensive, but whatever), both the Hunny and I had a large plate of Super Nachos, and the girl had a baby burrito. As a preteen, she's starting to eat more, yet this was too big for her. ""But it's still good."" She laughed that the insides kept falling out! My wife had pollo on her nachos, and I had carnitas. She found the chicken a little spicy, but still liked it enough to finish it up. I found the pork to have a nice taste too, although it was a little tough. We had two kinds of salsa with our chips, both were on the hot side; be warned.

Cilantro Taqueria's decor and food are a little too nice to be considered taco truck food. That's probably what you need to make it in this part of The City. The food is very good, though, and it's a place I recommend if you find yourself in this area.",4,4,7,7,1

"OMG so good thank you!!! I heard about this restaurant but was hesitant to drive 35-45 mins from my home to try the food. I must say it was worth it.

It was moist, warm and delicious",5,0,0,0,1
"Quick Summary
- Cute interior
- Dandy and kind workers
- Wait time is slow, but the atmosphere gives off a gentle slow mood
- Breakfast special is before noon (12pm)
- Breakfast special: scones, muffins, danish etc, have a limited supply
- Coffee is slightly sour as black, but it mellows out with cream
- Free coffee refills

We were heading to Trader Joe's but were growing hungry, so this came into view on the way to the store. On the window entrance, there was a sign that promoted breakfast, and it was just around that time.

I debated with either a cream cheese bagel or a scone, but decided on a scone. However, I entered the restaurant past 11am, so the scones were all sold out. This was a good opportunity because there were other desserts to try. In the spur of the moment, I requested the really large danish that looked like a cinnamon roll. 

I also ordered coffee and waited at the cashier for ""eat here."" There was a few people waiting for their orders, but it took a while for my order to arrive. It might be the restaurant's atmosphere or something, but the wait didn't feel long at all. The elderly workers had a gentle air, as well as the interior design, as if I was in a quiet village. 

The danish was very delicious! It was flaky and also had a crispy texture. I never had a crispy danish before, so it was a new taste. I thought the coffee was slightly sour, but after pouring cream, the sourness mellowed out. 

I think I found a great place to spend breakfast with a peaceful mood.",5,1,1,1,1
"One question: why is this place so good? Like seriously. 

This place is in the middle of a neighborhood. On the way there, I questioned if the restaurant was in located inside of a house. The plaza was basically in the center of a neighborhood. Interesting.

Calamari appetizer: 9/10 good sauce. Cocktail sauce and ranch. I would have liked for mine to be slightly crispier.

Fried artichokes appetizer: 10/10 I love the pesto sauce. Yum yum yum

Chicken piccata: 10/10 unexpectedly delicious. I was so shocked. The sauce was wonderful. 

Tried a bit if chicken masala. that was also surprisingly tasty.

A LOT Cheese is offered and it makes the food even better.

Don't judge a book by its cover more like don't judge a restaurant by how small it is. 

Can't really explain how surprised and impressed I was with the meal I had that night.

I love this place. Highly HIGHLY recommend.",5,2,6,2,1

They had heaters outside on the patio, lots of seating inside and out. The bathrooms were clean. The bar was kind of open which I thought was neat. We only had a few days in San Francisco but I will defiantly come back when visiting again. Big recommendation! Overall I had a great experience. Service and food was great",5,1,1,1,1
"Came here for a Saturday late lunch. Restaurant wasn't packed and had a very laid back vibe. 

We ordered the seafood pancake, spicy pork bibimbap and beef bulgogi grill. 

Seafood pancake was crispy on the edges and soft on the insides. Love the bits of octopus that gives a nice texture while chewing. It's not too doey or thick. Would recommend if you like Korean pancakes.

Spicy pork bibimbap was not spicy at all. I assume the flavour is more mild and tailored to the local taste. I would prefer to have that extra kick from the sauce. Love the sizzling bowl which gives some crunchy rice at the bottom. Bibimbap is very cucumber forward... I can definitely taste it in every single bite. 

Bulgogi was a little disappointing. Beef was thinly sliced so quite tough. Sauce is tastey tho. The layer of cabbage on the bottom soaked up a lot of the flavour. Would recommend trying another meat. 

Lastly, the side dishes... are very healthy? There was kale with spicy sauce and blanched brocolli, and some sort of spicy fried bean curd??",4,1,0,0,1
"Second dinner at the Franciscan. Good thing I wrote a review on my first visit, that way we didn't order the same thing twice!

I started with the clam chowder, while my cousin wanted to try the yellowtail carpaccio. The chowder didn't come with oyster crackers, but it was nice and meaty. I just wish is were are tad thicker. It was a little runny for me. I tried some of the carpaccio, it was really good.

Then it was time for dinner: garlic noodles and a whole crab.

The garlic noodles were really good. Lots of garlic in there. Not sure if adding meat would have made it better. The portion size was relatively small, and it was served on a huge plate. Noodles and sauce are cheap.

The crab was served on a sizzling platter. I ripped off a leg and cracked it. That first bite of hot crab, it was outstanding! I just wished it could have stayed piping hot throughout the meal.",4,0,1,1,1
"A true hidden gem restaurant in Hayward. If your not from here you would overlook this place for sure! Family owned for over a decade. This little gem can look duvet the owner has her own garden on the corner and rubs this restaurant/bakery.

We love going here for the Pho but as we take others here we have had the rice dishes, the spring rolls and a few others. The service is super friendly and the food is usually made in a timely manner and very good! 

There is a little parking lot so parking is easy. It's a little wierd because you have to approach the parking lot from a side street. Not ""d"" street. 

The baked good are very traditional french no high end cupcakes or fondont cakes...it's more buttercreams, and coffee cakes, and traditional cookies and wafers. She does do wedding cakes and things as well but I have never ordered one.

Bottom line if you want Vietnamese food do not hesitate to give this place a shot. When you walk in it's a little hodgepodge on the decorations and construction of the place but don't let that fool you, the food is great.",5,1,1,1,1

"First time having Bonchon in CA! (I think my first time was in NY) The place is a little small, and we came during the lunch rush, so there was a slight wait, although only about ~15 minutes or so. 

Spicy/ soy garlic wings and drums: To be honest, I expected the size of the chicken wings/drums to be bigger, considering this was a Korean chicken place. While some pieces were a decent size, we did get at least 3-4 that were pretty minuscule. Flavor-wise, it was really good. The spiciness of the wings is no joke and had me reaching for my water after every piece. It was still enjoyable though, and super addicting! The soy garlic was pretty good, not too salty, and very flavorful. I love that the chicken skin wasn't overly battered and was super crispy. Sauce was perfect, this place neither skimped on it nor drenched the chicken in it. 

Bulgogi Korean tacos: Pretty good! I was quite pleasantly surprised at how big they were too, since I was expecting tiny tacos. Flavor was pretty good, although the wings are the real winner here, haha.

Service was fine, and it wasn't too hard to find parking since it's located in a plaza. I would definitely come back if I was in the area and craving some wings!",4,0,0,1,1

"On a random whim, my wife and I decided to venture off the beaten path and try something new. We found this place on yelp and thought it looked awesome. As we walked in, we were greeted by a young man who patiently explained how things worked. We were attempting to order to go and chill at the bar. They were accommodating to both requests. The bar is beer & wine with some sangria options. I went with the Sapporo. My wife braved the sangria which she said packed a punch. We were ordering for a large family so we sampled quite a few dishes including: fish & chips, big-ol-bag of shrimp, sides of corn and potatoes and probably some other things I can't recall. The bill was reasonably priced and our family enjoyed the food. The same gentleman who greeted us at the door walked us through the menu and took our order and processed the payment. His customer service skillset was above par and appreciated. 
The decor of the place is extremely laid back with TVs everywhere and paper on the tables almost urging you to make a mess. Despite this invitation the place was clean and the decor was eclectic. I personally enjoyed the phone booth and the writing on the walls. Nice touch. Next time we'll bring the whole family!",4,0,1,1,1
"My rating system is as follows: a star for food, drinks, service, ambiance, ""other.""

Food: +1. I love the tzatziki, falafel and saganaki opa appetizers (discounted on happy hour). I've also tried their chicken shish kebabs and the falafel wrap, both were cooked well and had lots of flavor. My absolute favorite is the salmon with veggies and rice pilaf. Delicious!

Drinks: +1. Full bar and a large wine selection. Lots of yummy cocktails. 

Service: No star here for sure. Service is slower than usual since it's a small place and they, understandably, don't schedule many servers. my girlfriend and I went here for happy hour the other day and it took 3 hours to get 2 rounds of drinks and 3 appetizers. We were one of 3 tables there so the waitress was standing at the hostess stand, in plain sight, playing on her phone. I had to go inside after an hour and let her know we were out of water and wanted to order. So annoying. 

Ambiance: +1. Super cute greek theme. Very colorful and romantic. Great date spot. 

Other: +1. Great happy hour! M-F 3-6. $4 drinks and $5 appetizers. They also give out complimentary yummy bread, great for dipping.",4,0,2,0,1
"It was really packed for a Sunday lunch but for 2 people it was a 15 minute wait. When you first walk in, theres peanut shells all over the floor which makes sense because there's barrels of peanuts for you to snack on. 

the atmosphere is casual, very dark setting: think outback/applebee's vibes. the inside was decorated to theme! they showcase the meat out front for you to see that its not frozen! Our seat were the high stool ones which meant the table was very cramped and small.

The service was great! Our server, Samantha was super attentive and did an amazing job making sure we were good.

The food!! Steakhouses aren't really my thing so i thought it was alright. My boyfriend thought it was really good. A lot of the food is heavy, and overly salty in my opinion. My 16oz sirloin was delicious and well made. The 20oz bone in rib eye was flavorful but the texture wasn't so great, it had a dry pork chop consistency. They gave me a kids cup to fill my full lemonade and I thought no way is this going to fit; after pour out the ice, it fit! So consider that when you order.

Definitely worth to visit for the Texas style experience!",4,0,1,1,1
"Fast and yummy - definitely one of my favorite places to get thai food. My go-to's are the one-item yellow curry with rice, basil fried rice, and pad thai (I ask for no bean sprouts). Portions are a good size and I typically split the meal into two. You can definitely share any order with another person. 

It's kinda like Panda Express in the way they present the pre-made food and you go down the line to choose what you want. Some of the food items are made to order including any noodle/other rice dishes. If you're not looking to order any or the pre-made items, I suggest calling in since it takes maybe 5-15 minutes to cook.

One minor thing - though the lot is decently sized, parking can be really hard depending on the time of day e.g. lunch and dinner rush.",5,1,1,1,1
"This place was pretty good for the hotpot! My friends and I shared the seafood hotpot and it had a ton of clams, shrimp, fish tofu, mushrooms, and it came with a side of udon. The broth was also really tasty!

We also ordered the short rib plate that had I think about 5 ribs with sides of egg, corn cheese, and other pan chans. The picture looked better than it tasted to be quite honest.

Their menus are cool though because they are displayed on a mini iPad and you can digitally flip through the pages. Overall, this place was pretty good. Not in a rush to come back though.",4,1,2,2,1

We received excellent service along with two very tasty breakfast entrees.

"It took us a few weeks to get a reservation at a decent time, but we finally made it. We parked 2 blocks away and walked over, and there were plenty of parties discouraged by the long wait, or waiting for their reservation to come up.

We got seated within a few minutes of arriving, and definitely saw a lot of people on dates as we sat down. To start, I ordered the sangria lunarita, and the hubs ordered a cool as a cucumber. My drink ended up being very, very strong. We had to ask for lots of extra water and enjoyed a longer dinner just to sober up. 

The ceviche came next, and being the corn lover, I had to get the elote as well. Personally, the ceviche was overcooked from the lime, and turned out to be pretty spicy, hubby had to finish it for me. The elote was just ok flavor-wise, but the corn was a little dry, more likely due to a bad ear than being overcooked. 

Since they're known for their parradilladas, we ordered the combo grill of steak fajita and chicken breast, with an additional main of chile relleno. The flavor of the proteins and the chile was good, not dry nor over-cooked, even while the grill stayed lit. Luckily, we were sitting near the tortilla maker, and normally I don't like corn tortillas, but the masa they used was less gritty and more palatable for me, so we asked for quite a few extra helpings. The rice and beans also had a delicious salty and almost buttery flavor, I would have asked for seconds of those. 

We were already full and taking home leftovers, but since we were celebrating something, we asked if there was a half order of the bunuelos with ice cream. There wasn't, and guess what, we finished off the full sized dessert anyway. I loved the texture of the bunuelos. They were cripsy and didn't soften easily under the melted ice cream. The caramel was also extra tasty. With the build up of each course, this was definitely a great way to end the meal.

Service was excellent, albeit slow. Being that our drinks were strong, we didn't mind so much. Would I come back? Maybe for a special occasion. With the Campbell location open, I'd probably try that first.",4,1,2,2,1

Portions are a good size. 

So why isn't this a 5 star review? The food is a bit uneven. I find the hush puppies to be hard, dry, and inedible. Maybe I'm not going at the right time? Some of the sides are overly sweet and greens are your only option for a non-carb-based side. 

To go is your best option as inside seating is minimal. Don't miss the opportunity to talk to the owner Donnell.

"Every time I come to Din Tai Fung, they do not disappoint.

Whether you have a reservation or go on Yelp waitlist, you have to wait just a few minutes after check-in counter on the left side until your table is ready. Making a reservation is a lot easier since you know exactly when you'll need to check in vs waiting for waitlist. 

The service at our table was phenomenal every time we've been. They always ask if you've been here, and if not they'll give recommendations. To order, fill out the sheet while corresponding photos to the picture menu. The food came super fast, we felt like we didn't have to wait any more than 5 minutes for the Xiao Long Bao to arrive.

As for the food, it's delicious and it's high quality every time. The soup dumpling experience they have written on the card on the table is my favorite way to enjoy the dumplings. This time, we decided to try the truffle Xiao Long Bao (based on Buzzfeed Worth It). For the price, we will probably not order it again, but it was definitely worth it! A classic to get is the pork and shrimp spicy wontons. The sauce is so delicious and the wontons are soft and warm, with a slight crunch of the shrimp. To me, the sweet and sour ribs were fairly standard but of course, tasted delicious.

Din Tai Fung is a great place to get dim sum, and though it is not a classic dim sum style, it is very flavorful and worth the hype.",5,0,1,1,1

"Incredible new addition to the food options around UC Berkeley! 
Friendly service, delicious pasta, generous portions and very reasonable prices! 

I am very pleased to have checked out this new Italian restaurant that has recently opened up just down the street from UC Berkeley! We were craving pasta, didn't want to go to Gypsy's, and decided to give this new location a try! I am now very happy that we did and look forward to regularly coming back to satisfy my pasta and pizza cravings. 

The restaurant is very spacious and has a lovely open-air set-up, with tables both inside and outside of it, and large windows that can be opened up to let the breeze in and large awnings for shade outside. It was lovely and relaxing!

The menu has all the basic pasta styles and types that you could want, as well as some pizza options. It's a little bit extensive but not too much, and also very easy to read and understand. The service at the register was quick and friendly as well. 
The one thing I did notice was that the drink options were a little limited - they only had coke and sprite cans available. They do have a water station with nice tall glasses to fill, however, as well as a lovely cocktail/wine/beer menu at the bar! The cocktails were relatively reasonably priced at $7 and they had some nice sounding drinks, so I might try a few of them at some point or another. 
It would be nice if they could eventually get a soda fountain or more drink options alongside the coke and sprite cans at some point, but that wasn't too big of an issue!
The pasta dishes were also very reasonably priced - most, if not all of them were under $10. 

They also came in very generous portions! Large and very aesthetic plates were served and they were beautifully presented, with plenty of pasta, sauce and toppings to fill me up! I was very pleased to get nice and full off of delicious gourmet quality pasta for only $10! 
The food was prepared quite quickly and prepared fresh on the spot. I don't think we had to wait more than ten minutes. 
Also, the macaroni and cheese dish is only $5. I definitely want to try it out at some point, I love Mac N Cheese!!

I'm excited to have this new location in the area! The service was very quick and friendly, the pasta generously portioned and delicious, and the environment aesthetically pleasing and very relaxing. The prices are also very reasonable for what you are getting. The pasta's are all nearly gourmet quality!

"If you live(d) in Hayward in the South Hayward area, you know Cecils and Senaidas were the go-to spots near BART but Catrinas by SEIKI HOUSE is the next up and coming spot for the late night milk tea fiends who also need a little Mexican food. No Wi-FI for you boba and study people.

This spot is in the small parking lot right behind the train tracks and is a Mexican food and Taiwanese milk tea fusion restaurant. No Taiwanese food just in case you were wondering. The food is made Oaxacan style and there are some interesting choices here such as grasshoppers as a topping and mole which is very rare to find in Mexican restaurants in the area unless on special occasion. 

For food, we ended up trying the carne asada tlayuda which is basically a huge crispy tortilla topped with a little mole, cabbage, tomato and steak. Add some sauce to it and it is bomb! We also had the elote which didn't have all the bells and whistles as the ones off the cart and the carne asada plate which had grilled onions and jalapenos with beans, rice and a tortilla. Cooked very well in my opinion.

For drinks, we had their milk tea which they had run out of two flavors and one topping when we came. They also offer one free topping which was nice. They do a good job sticking to the drink descriptions!

"The first KBBQ joint I've ever been to and probably my favorite one to date! Dinner time around ~6pm gets extremely busy on weekends so be prepared to wait. They also don't allow reservations unless it's a party of 10 or more, I usually come right after lunch time and usually I don't have to wait.
 Gen servers are all so friendly and attentive as well as all the busters. For the most part they are prompt with grill changes and taking orders unless it is extremely busy. My favorite items to order are the bone in short ribs, Hawaiian steak, and Teriyaki pork chop. You can also order garlic and hot sauce on the side.
 The only con I can think of is if you are ordering multiple orders of the same item often times they don't bring out the full order. There is a two hour time limit and after tax is usually comes out to around $27 pp during dinner time which isn't bad for AYCE. I will be back!",5,0,0,0,1

I understand some people don't like changes but the new owners have been nothing but super sweet to me each time I come in and the noodles are still delicious. To be honest, I'm shocked their prices didn't go up(at least I can't tell), which would be reasonable to do since they're awesome and I'm not sure how they can survive at such low prices. It's still one of my fave noodle joints and I highly recommend.",5,0,0,0,1

"Loved!!!!!! Went on a Thursday night--it was really busy but we still got our table and food quickly. Our servers were great and they even had a DJ giving a really cool vibe. 

We ordered a number of rolls, all really good but my absolute favorite was the Volcano Roll!! It has peanut butter in it and OMG!! Loved it so much we ordered an additional roll of it. I love sushi and the concept of all the sudden having peanut butter--WOW!!! Definitely will return next trip to SF and will get that roll again.",5,0,1,0,1
"We were a large group and booked this place through Yelp reservations, last minute on a Friday night. So happy we have this place a shot...

Everything delicious! We were a bit skeptical at first being that the location is in the middle of an industrial zone and the waiter looked Asian. We were pleasantly surprised by the graciousness and overall level of service (Greeks know now to make you feel welcome!). We then were extra delighted by the food. I had the Greek salad and the bean soup (I'll admit I added a bit of salt, but I rather do that than have it too salty to begin with). All the ingredients were fresh. The appetizers were awesome. 

Will definitely come eat here again.",5,0,0,0,1
"Thanks to Yelp we found this as we were leaving the soccer field nearby with a hungry teenager. It's so great to get sandwiches and salads with the meat cut right from the bone before your eyes. I skipped the dressing on my salad, but there was plenty of flavor with all the vegetables mixed in. I had a bite of my son's sandwich and it was also very good. Overall the place was clean and the staff were friendly. We'll be back if we're in the area.",4,1,1,1,1
"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the south bay. Amazing food and ambiance and affordable prices. It's no wonder you need to book a few weeks in advance to get in during dinner hour. They do typically have late night availability and bar seating for those that want to pop in and try it. I've had several birthday dinners here because the food is so amazing. Bone marrow rib eye amazing, seabass delish, meatloaf, lamb lolipops, crab cakes, lobster and mushroom soups amazing, duck pasta amazing but rich, pork belly brussel sprouts are amazing, steak frites. The list goes on, you really can't go wrong. Perfect date night, they have outdoor seating for groups as well. Service is phenomenal",5,0,0,0,1
"Went here for a group-work lunch. We were impressed with this one. Got seated quickly, served water, ordered, served soup and then our entree. The wait staff made sure our water classes were always full (I like that).

Average price of their lunch specials run around $9.95. I went with the Pad See Ew with chicken. Generous portions and was nice to have something warm and a cold day. Definitely will come back for one of the rice dishes next time.",5,1,2,2,1
"I am really glad I came upon Tselogs within my first hour of landing on the West Coast. What a great welcome! I was hungry and sleep-deprived, and nothing could have hit the spot better than the Lechon Kawali Silog dish from their daily specials. The only thing that was more out-of-this-world than that crispy pork belly was the sweet chili garlic sauce that came with the crispy pork belly. Loved the garlic rice and sunny side up egg that came with it. 

Besides great food, the staff was really kind was well! Apparently, it was some guy's birthday (a customer) and they placed a candle on his plate to surprise him and sang happy birthday. That was so very sweet!",5,3,7,5,1
"I have been here at least 10 times now (or maybe more) since they have opened and I can say their food is delicious, consistent and the restaurant is very clean. I have been with large parties, with just another person, ordered take out etc and each time has been very good. 

The owner is extremely nice and takes a lot of pride in the restaurant. Some of the women that work there have a bad attitude, but the food is good, I'm not there for the service. I will say though that once they put gratuity for a party of 7 when they say it is only suppose to be for parties of 8 or more, kind of a bummer but not the end of the world, we always tip well anyway. 
Some of my favs:
-Both of the soups are yummy, I prefer the coconut based of the two.
-The papaya salad is far and away the best I have had in the Bay Area. They make the dressing fresh for the salad when you order it, there are even halves of the limes they use left in there. Be forewarned that the mild is still pretty spicy, but definitely worth it, I order it every time I go. Also has lots of peanuts for those who are allergic.
-All the curries, yum
-Pad Thai is pretty good, can sometimes be heavy on the fish sauce though
-Pad See Ew, Yes.
-Pork Belly, Very Good.
-Roti, I love roti but theirs is way way too oily. The last two times we ordered it it was a mouthful of oil, no exaggeration,I actually spit it out. I want to love it but I can't :( Thats really the only thing that I had an issue with. Maybe remove some of the oil with a paper towel before it comes out?

If you are trying to find a place to eat definitely go here and enjoy delicious Thai food!!",5,0,0,0,1
"This is a very lamb heavy restaurant. There's only one chicken dish and one beef dish. Tried all of their specialties and they all taste great. You cant go wrong with any. Flavors are great. Portions are good, but still high for the price.

Food:
Braised Lamb Shank ($16) - Very tender and practically fall off the bone. Sauce was delicious too. Not sure whats up with the naan tho, youll want to eat it almost right away to prevent it from getting even more soggy.

Polo w/ yogurt or salad ($14) - Meat inside was decent, but the rice was delicious. Not sure what kind of seasoning they use for it. Theres also some raisins to give it a lil sweetness.

Big Plate Chicken ($16/28)- Got the regular size for this. The noodles were good. The sauce has a lil spice since the dish is cooked with jalapenos or some kind of chili pepper. The chicken is surprisingly very tender as well.

Lamb Kabab/Skewer ($3)- These go for 3 bux a skewer so its not cheap at all. But damn theyre so good. Would suggest getting an order of 2 just to try.

Overall, I enjoyed pretty much all the dishes ive had from here. My main gripe is the price point. It could def come down by 2 bux.",4,0,1,0,1
"I highly recommend their jokbal!! I recently went to eat jokbal (pork feet) after seeing an advertisement in a Korean magazine. We ordered the spicy jokbal, and it was very delicious--just as good as the kind I have had in Korea. It is very spicy so beware! The meat tasted very fresh, and did not have a stinky pork smell at all.
We also ate the cold noodle dish with the spicy meat which was a good match. The cold noodles helped to cool down the spice. 
Overall, I had a very good experience, and am definitely going to come back to this restaurant.",5,0,1,0,1
"Yo...these fries are DYNO-MITE!!

I went here recently for some lunch and I was really surprised at my experience. First off, I had no idea this shopping center even existed in Walnut Creek. The parking situation is pretty solid. Theres parking spaces all around. But lets get to the menu.

I love the menu. Just imagine if Long John Silvers had a baby with Urban Eats in Pleasant Hill. California Fish Grill has a moderate seafood menu with a few tweaks here and there. They got Tacos, bowls, salads and soups as well. And since we are on the subject of Soup, definitely try the Clam Chowder. It was super creamy and tasty! 

I also ordered the Classic Combo because I've been on a Fried Seafood kick. Actually let's be real...I'm always down for Fried Seafood of some sort lol. But I digress. I chose the Shrimp with the Calamari and I was super satisfied with it. Both the shrimp and calamari were decently sized and combined with the cocktail sauce, had amazing flavor. Oh yea. Definitely check around the corner for all the sauces to choose from. They got Ketchup, Tarter Sauce and all that good stuff. They also have their own fancy sodas! :O

Oh!! And last but not least, if you have the opportunity to upgrade your fries to Dynamite Fries, you definitely have to do so. The sauce with the chilis gives it such a nice sweet and spicy flavor. I mean potatoes are always amazing in itself but add something like this to it and you are just genius. It really brings out the rest of the meal out too. On one instance you have the fried and tangy flavors with the Shrimp and the Calamari. But then on the other hand you have the sweet and spiciness of the fries. 

Whoever are the owners of the this chain are brilliant. Sometimes people don't wanna go to a restaurant and have to pay and arm and a leg for some Seafood. But then again maybe they don't wanna go somewhere as cheap either. California Fish Grill is a perfect middle ground. You have a diverse menu which has something for everyone; even if they don't want Seafood. On top of that you have Alcoholic beverages too?!? And your workers are nice?!? AND you can take your food to the Brewery down the street and not get hassled?!?!??!? I'm going going...back back...to er-wait a minute...Already live here...But I am definitely going back to California Fish Grill. No doubt about that.",5,1,5,2,1
"This place was amazing! I'm so happy Concord has a restaurant like this. We came pretty late, probably around 9. The ambiance was totally suitable for date night or casual dining with friends. It's a small and intimate restaurant.

I will definitely come back!",5,2,3,2,1

"Since having Tsukemen (dipping ramen) in Japan, I've been trying to find an equivalent ramen experience close to home. Enter Yelp. Yelpers raved about the Tsukemen at Ramen Taka (near Ike's and across The Alameda from Santa Clara U). Because I know that Tsukemen broths are unique to each ramen house, I wasn't expecting the same flavor as Japan, but I was impressed by the pork/miso broth nonetheless. Albeit, the broth had a strong bonita flavoring. Additionally, the chew to the thick noodles was also worth the price of admission. In the broth were 3 1/2 thick pieces of pork belly and plenty of bamboo shoots. 

As an homage to Japan, I also ordered the Takoyaki and Karaage. Both appetizers were good, but I expected the Karaage to be somewhat more tender, but the pieces were good sized.

In case my Tsukemen was a bust, my dining companion ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu which had well flavored pork bone broth. He, too, was impressed with the chew of the noodles.

Things I learned: A cup of hot water (owari) is served mid-way through the meal to heat and dilute the Tsukemen sauce. And, Kaedama (extra ramen noodles) is available for $1.25, but only the hot ramen noodle size and NOT the thicker Tsukemen size. OK by me.

Our server was SUPER friendly and was able to answer all my questions. Now that I don't have to fly to Japan, I look forward to returning to Ramen Taka in nearby Santa Clara.",5,2,6,3,1
"I get why people like this little place! The tacos are really yum! The service is great too. They give you fresh chips and a green sauce/salsa which I could eat all day and they keep them coming! Our server brought out three tacos accidentally for one person in our party but since we didn't order it, didn't charge for it and let us keep it. More deliciousness to try! Our favorites were the fish, both sea bass and halibut. We liked pastor more than carnitas. Shrimp is blackened but not bad. If I only had one complaint was that there was more cabbage than I like and I could have used more sauce. But still very good so I'm not really complaining. :)",5,0,0,0,1
"Pleasant, casual restaurant. Excellent staff. Portions are very, very generous here. (Note that we are NOT lomo saltado fans so read other rvws if that's what you are looking for.)

Soup: chicken noodle. Herbaceous green broth with generous chicken shreds was excellent, altho a cup size would be appreciated.

Chicken Empanada. Every restaurant makes these differently. This is the largest meat pie we've gotten from anyone (8 Peruvian SFBA restaurants and counting). The soft thick pastry is surprisingly tender and tasty; tasty shredded chicken in a spicy tomato-based gravy. Top sprinkled with confectioner's sugar, making this reminiscent of the Moroccan bastilla. Spouse enjoyed it; I preferred it without the sugar. One pie to an order; would easily serve two or even three as a starter.

Anticuchos. Both pork belly and beef heart were excellent.

Ceviche, red snapper. Possibly rockfish instead of true red snapper, but fresh and sweet. Excellent balanced marinade. Not overloaded with raw onion shreds (hurrah!!) and to our surprise, corn nuts seemed housemade. We normally hate them but these were delicious.

Grilled salmon with white beans. Outstanding. The salmon was good and the beans were better than what Chez Panisse gave us two years ago.

Skip the rice pudding - much too stolid and starchy - for the lucuma ice cream.

We would rank Barranco up with LIMA/Concord and Tambo/Oakland. All have certain dishes they do extremely well, but all three do excellent anticucuchos, empanadas, and ceviches. Note: Parking can be difficult at peak times.",5,2,2,2,1

"Nothing better than a family run Mexican restaurant that uses old time family recipes.

I had the chicken mole and it had a deep rich brown flavor, one of the best I have ever had. The tomali and California enchilada were also excellent. Rice, beans and tortillas, all good. Chips and salsa - watch out for the spicy one!

The peach and cranberry margaritas were a nice change from traditional and there were a half dozen beers on tap to choose from.

The portions were big and the service was fast and friendly. The parking is OK but watch out for the dumpster when you turn left behind the building to make an exit.",5,2,2,2,1
"Yay, a Boiling Point close by! I do prefer the original locations over the Concept. Prices are more expensive than regular BPs since they use organic ingredients.

I've been here twice, once during soft opening and a few weekends ago. They had run out of white rice so went with the brown rice (no additional charge). Pretty standard process of ordering. Medium spice came with just the right amount of spice. The tea is alright, but more $$ as well. I'd come back mainly for the hot pot when I need my BP fix. Nice ambiance and clean space.",4,1,2,2,1

San Tung's chicken wings are legendary and I came to try them.����� Golden wings were covered in a sticky sauce with a bit of sweetness and a bit of spiciness.����� Delicious mix of flavors from the batter, the sauce, and the chicken wings.����� Chicken was tender and juicy.����� These are the best wings I've found in San Francisco.

"Flavia Osteria is a pretty good new Italian spot on Center and Oxford. I have been here twice, ordering the Fettucine Alfredo on my first visit and the Mac and Cheese on my second. The Fettucine Alfredo (about $10) tasted fresh and creamy, just how I like it (although, I wish the serving size was a little bigger). The Mac and Cheese at around $5 is a great deal. I tried it on a whim since it's was advertised on their sidewalk billboard, and was not disappointed: it was creamy and filling, yet very affordable. The person who took my order on both of my visits was super nice and friendly (he might be the owner). 

The restaurant is big and spacious, so it's a good spot to grab food with friends. The design and environment of the place is kind of like a better version of Gypsy's (on Durant Ave). Flavia Osteria also has a TV, so this a possible place to see a game. They also have self-serve water and use mason jars as water cups, which is pretty cool. I will definitely be back to try more of there dishes.",4,0,1,1,1

We ordered several dishes and everything was amazing. You can order meat and cook it on a grill or you can order ramen, rice dishes and appetizers. They have a happy hour but it is only Mon-Thu. 

My friend ordered steak and he cooked it on the grill. The rest of us order ramen and some appetizers. Let me tell you, the spicy miso ramen is delicious. Not very spicy but it has a good spice. The meat that is in the ramen falls apart and it has amazing flavor. We ordered a side of Tako Yaki (fried octopus balls) which was one of the best ones I've ever tried. It had a lot of flavor and it wasn't too fishy tasting which I don't like at other places. We also ordered the Tori Karaage ( deep fried boneless chicken) $7 This dish was big!!

"Enjoyed my birthday dinner here immensely. Great food. Great service. All as expected. 

The one thing I really don't understand or feel is appropriate is the way the hostesses were dressed. There were two women working who were STUNNING. But the dresses they were wearing were out of sync with the style and class of the rest of the place. Simply put, they did not match the tone or ambience of such a beautiful restaurant. Read: Tight, short, cheap-looking, more for the club than a Michelin starred restaurant. I don't know if these young women have been instructed to dress like this or if they are given the choice of how they dress, but someone in the management needs to provide a little more guidance on appropriate, sophisticated, classy attire. In the same way the men who are working there are required to wear buttoned up shirts and ties, the women should be expected to dress with as much class and elegance. 

Other than that, it was a great evening.",4,0,2,1,1
"Got together with an old buddy last weekend. He suggested Kabul as it had been several years since we've eaten there. The last time I ate at Kabul was in their old location. The new location is in downtown Sunnyvale and a huge upgrade. Downtown Sunnyvale has been going through a major revitalization project over the past few years and I'm so glad the folks at Kabul are part of it. Once completed the new downtown area will be a destination spot for people in the area. 

On to the food. Let me open by saying that I'm a complete rookie to Afghan food. We started out with an appetizer Aushak (spring onion-filled dumplings topped with yogurts & meat sauce). Wow. It was excellent. We were both hungry and dived into it very quickly. 

I had the Korma Challaw (chunks of beef with green pepper, tomatoes, onion, garlic & spice, served with their seasoned rice). This is my Go-To dish, although I hadn't eaten there in many years. It was as delicious as I remember. The beef was so tender and I spooned it over my rice. Thankfully, there was enough sauce to dip their special bread into. Oh, yeah. You know I cleaned my plate.

My buddy had their Combo Kabab plate. It looked and smelled fantastic.

All in all it is a great place for dinner. The service was excellent and everyone seemed to know my buddy. I am so happy for them in their new (somewhat) place. I will definitely be going back.",4,3,3,3,1

"This was my first time trying Vietnamese hot pot and I was pleasantly surprised. The two of us shared #38 small (Spicy Thai Seafood Hot Pot) with rice noodles and #1 (Banh Khot). The Banh Khot were these crispy airy balls with some shrimp paste inside. When you put some fish sauce and stuff some basil/mint inside, it's delicious! The Spicy Thai Seafood Hot Pot was like a tom yum broth and had a variety of seafood (shrimp, squid, fish balls, muscles, clams, and vegetables/mushrooms). You get a whole plate of noodles too. We couldn't finish everything so this amount would probably be perfect for 3 people.
I think this is good value for good food. Service was just a little slow and it was hard to get a server to refill tea. Parking in the plaza was difficult for a Sunday night since it's a small lot.

The chicken and waffles are ""light"" and delicious, would recommend. Don't expect the most fried crispy chicken though, this is almost like chicken tenders atop waffles. Good if you're in the mood for that. Bloody Marys and Marias are decent, don't think they make their own mix though.",4,0,0,0,1

"My friends and I had every intention of going to Amakara in Dublin for dinner one weekday evening...but to our dismay, it was closed due to relocation. We were all driving in from different cities and ended up coming together in a random parking lot to do an impromptu Yelp search for our next best option.

That's when we found Yayume.

Having learned from our earlier mistake of not calling ahead of time, we called Yayume and made a quick reservation for the next 15 minutes. 

Parking in this plaza is very easy to find, the restaurant itself is a little small, but we we happily had our reserved seating. 

I absolutely. positively. love my food here. I always over-order when I eat at Japanese establishments...so I got the Katsu Don Rice Bowl - HUGE portion, piping HOT, and delicious! Best part is that the meat to rice ratio was on point. Basically you have the steamed white rice on the bottom, layered with pork katsu, and a fried scrambled egg, topped with sauteed onions, nori, and yummy sauce. 

I also opted for the Oahu Roll which lives up to its name. The tuna was fresh. And the roll is FLAVORFUL, sprinkled in masago. For both orders, I spent about $30. Standard.

"Tried this place for the first time last month. So happy we did. 

The pupusas were the best we've had. Flavorful and not particularly oily. We had one of the cheese and one of the mixtas, and intend to go back to try all three styles of the mixtas pupusas. 

The tamales were mild yet satisfyingly savory. The pork was our favorite, but the chicken was great too. Note that the chicken tamale has bone-in chicken; though slightly inconvenient, I am convinced it added to the richness of that chicken; it was the richest tasting chicken tamales I've ever had. Delightful. 

The burrito camerones was also mild yet flavorful. Seasoned rice, pinto beans, cheese, and properly cooked shrimp. It was not the most flavorful I've ever had, but it was very satisfying and well executed. The texture and flavor of the shrimp were perfect and not overpowered by the other elements.

Seating is subway style bench-booths to the side, with proper tables down the middle. The restaurant seemed kinda cramped, but it was set up for a big party, with all the tables lined up as a single with chairs backing into the sides of the booths. I suspect this is not the usual configuration. 

Special thanks to Harbor Fish and Chips for being closed without posting or notice. If they were not closed, we might not have tried Maya Cafe.

Regardless of the cramped environment, I say try Maya Cafe. Try it for take-out if seating is a concern. Definitely try the pupusas. Again, I note, the pupusas were the least oily we've ever had, yet there was still enough to prevent the bread from seeming dry; the perfect balance.",5,0,1,0,1

"This review is solely for the Thursday biriyani and disa buffet. The name can be a bit deceiving because you are in a treat for other dishes too, in addition to biriyani and dosas.

The buffet started with five dishes including chutneys and raita/curd. This buffet is worth every penny for vegetarians too, as they have a wide option of veg dishes. 

The veg section started with mysore bonda and baby corn manchurian. The bonda was spongy and fluffy and really good with the chutney. There were two varieties of biriyani for vegetarians, the classic veg biriyani and paneer biriyani and two rice items, plain rice and lemon rice. The paneer biriyani was too good. Almost five veg curries were there, including bittergaurd fry, navaratna korma and sambar. Flatbre ad was limited to naan. My favorite combo in the veg section was the naana and navaratna korma. 

The non-veg section started with chilly chicken and kabab as appetizer, followed by four types of biriyani. My favorite was the Vijayawada chicken biriyani. There were two chicken curry, butter chicken and andhra chicken curry both of which I did not try because I was full.

Since the name said dosa buffet I thought there would be a variety of doses, but I got only two. Also the dosa kept coming in from the kitchen and got over really soon.

The buffet had two desserts, rice kheer and kesari along with unlimited supply of mango lassi. Overall a superb variety of dishes for q really good rate.",5,0,4,0,1
"This is like a mom and pop hole in the wall feel type of restaurant. I was first introduced by a friend and honestly I was a little unimpressed at the beginning since it was just noodles. Yes, I'm asian, BUT I don't really care for noodle type things... However, this place is an eyeopener! Their dry pho is to DIE FOR 

I got the the number 8 with ho fun this time, it was still bomb, but I highly suggest their wide egg noodle (dry). Literally, BOMB, mix it with their hot sauce, hoisin, and a mix of the chili sauce. I promise you, to die for!! They also serve it with a side of chicken soup!

The owner usually comes by to take your order, and he is so sweet, cute, and nice! For newcomers, just ask him what to order, he will let you know what's best!",5,1,2,1,1

"I'm really glad I ""figured out"" that this is the same place as Mission Street BBQ in Santa Cruz and Aptos Street BBQ in Aptos. When I used to go home over the hill I'd make a point to go to Mission St BBQ because I couldn't get it in SJ, but now I can eat at other places I like in Santa Cruz County since I can get South Winchester BBQ anytime.

My go to for all of these places is the regular tri tip sandwich on garlic bread. It's amazing and just the right size. I've had several of their other offerings as well, and all are pretty spectacular. I'd say the only 2 things I've found that I wasn't over the moon about were the pulled pork mac n' cheese (kind of bland) and the side offerings that come with the sandwich (I usually just get regular potato chips as a result). 

All of the locations, including this one, have a great beer selection and as many free Andes Mints as you can consume.

This location has a large outdoor patio to sit on that's pretty great when the weather is nice. Even when it's way too hot outside it's a pretty good place to sit, eat, drink, and hang out because it just makes it feel more like proper Texas BBQ...........",5,0,1,0,1

"The Butcher's Son is delicious and well worth the wait in my opinion (we didn't even wait long).

My sister and our friends took Bart to downtown Berkeley and walked over to have ""Brunch"". The folks aren't overly friendly (standard for vegan spots in the bay) but the food is really good.

While they're pricey, their portions are huge!

Jalape�����o Business - Served on a Soft Hoagie with Seasoned Steak, Cashew Pepper Jack Cheese, Double Bacon, Fresh & Pickled Jalape�����o, Sriracha Mayo

Cold Cut - Served on a French Roll with Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles Chips, Red Onion, Cheddar Cheese, Salt & Pepper, Oil & Vinegar, Dijon Mustard & Mayo

"I took a group of my friends here because I realized they'd never tried russian food. For me it's mostly a home food thing so I don't often go out to eat it but its always comforting. Anyways the food at red tavern is solid, albeit not particularly cheap. I don't know if I had a favorite (russian food is kinda even keeled in such a way that it's hard to like a particular dish too much) but blini with caviar is something I've missed and I liekd the pelmeni too.

It's weird that they don't have a liquor license. You can get beer and wine but really some vodka is in order. We tried to bring some bottles but they said we couldn't BYOB. They should get whatever the requisite license is",4,1,2,2,1
"Standard korean tofu pot 

Got the beef bulgogi, combination tofu pot, and the spicy cheese ramen (looked interesting, wanted to try)

Beef bulgogi was a bit more....wet than I was used to, and a little too sweet with the seasoning

Tofu pot was good, lots of toppings inside 

Spicy cheese ramen with rice cakes was pretty spicy (I usually eat more mild food), cheese melted nicely in it. I had to eat some rice in between bites to kind of help with the spiciness

"They know where we like to sit. They know my order before I sit down. My family comes here weekly because the food is simply divine. Today I tried a new dish! It's the Indian salad. Don't expect green leaves on this kind of salad. It's made with chopped seedless cucumber, tomato, carrots, onion seasoned with roasted cumin seed, olive oil, lime juice and a chat masala. The salad comes in a special vessel. Papadam- lentil wafer that is crispy. I had so much left over that I was able to use it in a chicken dish the next day. My staple and holy grail dish is the chicken tikka masala. The marinated chicken breast, encased in a tomato creamy tikka sauce, would be my last supper dish. My son tried the vegetable pakora that comes with three dipping sauces. The same sauces used for the salad dressing! Prices are $-$$. Great for families. Restaurant is located among many shops so parking is a breeze. Even though I'm a regular, the owners let you be in peace. They keep our relationship cordial and friendly. I just had to inquire about the name selection for their restaurant, which has a special meaning! Pia is the owner's young daughter. This place is a must try.

"As a chick who habitually still buys banh mi whenever she goes home to visit her parents in San Jose, I have to give props to Banh Mi Ba Le for their great bang-for-your-buck. At the $3-3.50 price point for nearly all their banh mi, you really can't find a better spot to get your fix in the El Cerrito/Richmond area. It's still not as stacked as my all-time fave (111 Bakery), but it's way more convenient than driving down to south bay.

#2, Banh Dac Biet, has a little bit of everything- jalapeno slices, pickled veggies, cha lua, cilantro, and of course my beloved pate. Bread is not as fresh as some other places, but it does the job.

Banh bot loc, was also perhaps not was as fresh as possible, but the shrimp inside were larger than I would have expected and the price was reasonable for the tray. Considering the effort it takes to assemble and steam the darn things myself, I'll gladly get another tray of these in the future if I'm craving them.

"Much more casual michelin restaurant than others in the city. Reservations were easy to come by, made only a week before. 

The hand crafted cocktails really are worth the hype. We had 2 each and they were all spectacular. Do order!! 

We decided to order the chicken wings and basteeya for appetizers. I decided on the sea bass for my entree, and V the braised lamb shank. 

We were given flatbread to start our meal. V loved it. I found the texture to be a bit doughy, but great flavors. 

The boneless chicken wings are a treat! 6 pieces that tease you with deliciousness. Being a wings guy, V wished he could order a entire basket of these! 

The duck basteeya was delicious! Must get! Filled with tender duck confit and the sweet and salty make a great combo. It is on the heavier side. After this, I was already getting full! 

The sea bass was cooked perfectly. Crispy skin, tender inside. The sauce was good and the little accompaniments went well together. BUT THE SAUCE. Oh that sauce made the dish. V enjoyed his lamb shank, but he mentioned that it just looked much bigger than it actually was. I just tried a taste of the sauce and found it flavorful. 

No dessert for us. But we were given complimentary chocolates that were just the right tough of sweetness to finish the meal. 

When we first arrived the restaurant was practically busy, although by the time we were done with our entrees it was buzzing and packed! It seemed there was limited staff so it was difficult to get the attention of our server near the end of our meal. 

Side note: it got ridiculously hot inside. It didn't help that the city had very high temperatures during the day, but wish they had AC! There were multiple people fanning themselves with napkins to keep cool. I'm not a huge fan of eating and sweating. Blech. But I'm sure it was just a glitch.",4,7,9,6,1

"Woohoo! An awesome little Sichuan place in Walnut Creek!

I've been looking for a replacement for Yu Yuan in Millbrae, which used to be my all-time favorite Chinese restaurant. Yi Yuan changed ownership and was renamed earlier this year, and the food hasn't been the same there. Not only is Sichuan House located much closer to me than Yi Yuan, but many of its dishes are also better! Win, win! This place is great.

One of my favorite dishes at Little Sichuan is the spicy wontons. This is a crazy delicious dish. The wontons are very nicely made, and they're swimming in a delicious, slightly spicy sauce that is packed with flavor. Really great, and it rivals the spicy wontons at Din Tai Fung.

The spicy boiled fish is delicious, and it's served with a spicy sauce and cabbage that goes great with rice (really good as leftovers). The fish is tender and flaky, and the ma la flavor from the Sichuan peppercorns is really nice. It's not too hot, but really big on flavor. Quite different from the Yi Yuan version, which featured a very soupy broth. This dish has a much thicker sauce.

The sesame bread with scallions here is delicious. This is a northern Chinese specialty, which is a pan-fried bread filled with scallions and topped with toasty sesame seeds. Use it to sop up gravy from other dishes, stuff meat into it, or just eat it plain. So good, and also great for leftovers (heat it up in an oven for a crispy leftover treat)

The house lamb was a very tasty dish, and went really well with the sesame bread. Thinly sliced lamb tossed with cilantro and a tasty sauce. Yum.

The dry fried green beans, a staple of Sichuan cuisine, is also really good. Lots of fried garlic make this a tasty veggie dish.

Next time, I'll have to try the dan dan noodles and some other dishes. But my first impression is that I have found my new favorite Sichuan place close to home!",5,0,2,1,1
"I love this Filipino inspired place. It's definitely a must try and after eating here, I loved reading the history of how this place started as a food truck.
*Note: I am rating this place as a Filipina, so my perspective may be different than others.*

My party got the lechon kawali, bangus (milkfish) special, and the longanisa hash.

lechon kawali- It super crisp and it comes with garlic rice and egg! The pork belly was cooked well and it comes with a small salad!

bangus- This was half of the fish, but I thought it would be the full fish because of how small it was (maybe I was too hungry). The fish was seasoned perfectly and tasted similar to what I would have at home. It comes with rice and egg, nom! For those who have never had this dish, it is more on the sour side as they use vinegar. 

Longanisa hash- I didn't expect the longanisa to be cut up into small pieces, but the dish was still good. The potatoes it comes with are sooooo crisp and crunchy- it's even better that it's cut up into small pieces. The dish doesn't come with rice, so I had to order a side of rice. 

Overall, the brunch food is delicious and I will definitely be coming back for their dinner menu. You may find the prices to be too high, but I highly recommend supporting this business because other Filipino/a restaurants don't compare!",4,1,1,2,1

As far as sides corn muffin, red beans, potato salad, greens, all perfect. Mac and cheese my least favorite. Definitely a hidden jewel and I will return again and again!",5,1,1,1,1
"This place has some great crispy fried chicken. I was in the area for a music festival and were ready for the drive back home to LA. My GF was craving Kimchee rice and some Korean fried chicken. We found this place about 6 minutes away from the Hilton Concord Hotel. We got 2 orders of kimchee rice and 1 order of Fried chicken with the spicy sauce on the side. 

We took the meal to go and ate it on the drive back. It was honestly amazing. The chicken was super crunchy and the sauce was a good mix of sweet and mildly spicy. The rice was good too. Had a rich flavor and can actually take the kimchee.",5,0,0,0,1

Everything was fresh and portions were decent. I enjoyed the ratio of veggies to protein. The dishes had tasty flavors and weren't oily. Price was responsible.

I would go back to try the other pastas too, since all of them sounded great. The specials everyday are super good too, would recommend those as well!

The service was great, the owner (or who seemed to be the owner) took special interest in the customers and their experience, talking to you about how you liked the food and helping you decide when ordering.

I love their closed sign.",4,0,0,0,1
"Super solid. I've been here 5 times now, and each meal offered at least one memorable item, if not a few. I really appreciate its mix of always-on-the-menu reliable favorites coupled with in-season rotations and variations. You can always count on a very good homemade pasta and a risotto, but it won't be the same setup. However, they are consistently good.

On my first visit I had such notably amazing cocktails in the also notably amazing $12 range (not cheap, but for SF, well below average). On subsequent visits, the perfect foams and handmade potions and shrubs fell short. Good/solid cocktails, but not memorable and crave worthy like my first visit.

Over time they have improved the veggie pot pie. It's nowhere close to the legendary veggie pot pie at Bernal's Liberty Cafe (RIP), but it's gotten better from where it was with a greater mix of veggies, such as brussels sprouts on the last visit. One the first visit it was like pearl onions, carrots, and potatoes, and nothing else. The expanded breadth makes all the difference.

The menu really seems to have something to offer everyone, and in addition to vegetarian options, they can often make something vegetarian, such as leaving meat off something. Those of us who are sensitive to such things REALLY PREFER either a substitute or a couple bucks off. Say, rather than offering a meat risotto and saying you can leave the meat off, how about offering a veggie risotto with a meat add-on option for a few extra bucks? We get tired of paying for things we don't eat.

The staff skews HEAVILY male, at least on the 5 visits I've made. It's a bit odd. It's also not the best and most consistent service. But they try.

Overall, it's really a go-to for me in the Hayes Valley-Civic Center area, and I hope it sticks around for a long time. I also LOVE the all-day options with good (looking) breakfast program. I hope it gets a lot of success and becomes a model for similar places.",4,0,0,0,1

*Steak fajitas: meat cooked perfect, came out sizzling wit veggies and sweet potato. Handmade corn tortillas. 
*cochinita pork: this is definitely a must. Great flavor and a good portion. Topped pickled habanero was very spicy, but mix it in adds another level.
*La Bamba cocktail was very good I recommend

I love going to The Halal Guys for a few different reasons... but mainly for their red sauce. I love HOT HOT food. Anything that gives that strong kick is getting closer to the top of my list.

"Came in for lunch with a friend. Plenty of parking everywhere. The place was smaller than I imagined but still plenty of seating. Lunch was slow. 
Greeted by the waiter and then he proceeded to explain the buffet and how it works.
They give you menus where you check off the sushis you like and will eat. There is also appetizers you can order. It clearly states that food that is wasted will be charged! So don't go all crazy ordering everything and then leaving it-I hate when people do that-so wasteful.
We started with a miso soup, gyosas and edemame. They were all great. Gyosas were crunchy and tasty. 
Next we got an avocado roll (6small pieces)
 Lion king roll-very good
49er roll-also delish 
 Salmon roll excellent.
I was pleasantly surprised because 1-Im not a fan a buffets.
2- I had my doubts it would be fresh, wrong again.
3-I thought they would be slow at serving and bringing the food. Wrong again.
4-bad service-nope service was great.
We wanted to try more but just could not. We had a very satisfying and delish lunch. We got to try a bunch of items and only left 1 piece of roll. 
Water was always being filled and service was always prompt. 
About $23 pp plus tip. Great deal. Big eaters this place is for you. Dinner has some added options.

They have us a table in the back - one of those booths with a recess for your feet.

We ordered the beef tongue, chunky beef tongue, salmon carpaccio, salmon stone pot, mochi with fried eggplant and nato, and tuna sashimi.

The stone pot was easily the best part because it comes with ikura. However, all of our food was delicious.

Food was good, pretty standard menu (pho incl. vegetarian options, noodle, rice dishes, spring rolls), and it came out fast. Service however seemed a bit overwhelmed by the amount of patrons, then again, it just shows how popular this restaurant is.

"I'm usually faithful to my Thai place on Taraval so I came here with some doubts. 
Can they do a great job? (Kinda)
Will I enjoy it? (Yes)

Ordered:
-combination plate (chicken and papaya salad with a single order of sticky rice)
- eggplant with tofu
- Tom yum noodles
- order of rice (which never came)
- iced JASMINE tea (all caps bc it wasn't just regular tea) 

My friends and I came here at 10 PM. It was very busy; then again it was also Friday night. We decided to divide and conquer so each couple- there were three couples - ordered and paid on their own... This made paying much more easier.

I'm taking off a star because the waitresses could do a much better job. There are a lot of them. They were not very attentive. First thing our particular server asks when we all sat down... What do you want to drink? I said ""waters all around, please."" That never came out. We did order other drinks too, but our waters never arrived. Another server comes asking what we want to drink and we said someone already took out order...she gave a confused look and walked away. A third server came asking if we wanted a drink...we said someone is coming. 

When they brought out the food, since we had a table of 6, a server would just drop it off - with no mention of the dish's title - on one side of the long table when we pointed and directed where each dish was going. Surprisingly, we all ordered family style among three couples and didn't have repeat dishes! The plates weren't hot so they could've just walk a little further to drop off the food with it's respectful orderer. (I know, I know...I'm being melodramatic and ""extra"" and I have no idea what goes on in the food service industry so I should be more patient....) I had to call on three waitress asking for a refill on water. 

Overall food was good. Papaya salad is super spicy. The grilled chicken needed the sweet chili sauce. The eggplant with tofu was typical fare. The noodles looked like a noodle soup without the broth....but OMG the crispy pork belly. A must order!

"I was visiting Berkeley with the person I'm dating and we wanted to go here since it's both a favorite of mine and they haven't had a chance to experience it yet. We are both vegan, but I decided to was also a good opportunity to invite two non-vegan friends with us who had recently moved to Berkeley. 

My date ordered the Killer B.L.A.T. and I ordered the half size of the Omsalada with Hot Seasoned Steak Meat. My date liked their food but thought there were too many tomatoes and the sandwich was too big to actually bite. That's just the style of this kind of food though, so no real complaints. 

My Omsalada was okay, but I felt like I didn't get that much Hot Seasoned Steak Meat for $4 extra, so if I get this again it will be without any extras and to share the half size with someone else as a side. 

The two non-vegans absolutely loved their food and one of them was highly skeptical that she would like vegan food, so it was super cool to see her really enjoy eating here. 

I'll definitely be coming back frequently and love taking new people here.",5,8,12,13,1

Have come here on many occasions and you really cannot go wrong with your order. Particular favorites of mine are the pork tacos and the papusas.

I always go for the besos, but like the other menu items these pastries never fail to satisfy. 

After you order at the counter, you seat yourself in the dining area. Although it can get crowded, I've never had a problem finding a place to sit.

Service... was great! I came when it was kinda slow, but they were on it. Attentive and quick. Checked up on me. Just easy. 

I'd highly recommend this place.

And if you want a amazing burger, this is the place.",5,0,1,0,1

"Came in on a Friday night with a reservation, but it probably wasn't needed. With most of our preferred izakaya places on the west side of the city, having Noren in North Beach is a nice alternative. At $4.50 per single skewer, Noren can end up being pricier than other izakaya places depending on what you get. We tried:
- Chicken tail (5/5) - Fatty, well seasoned, and delicious.
- Tsukune (5/5) - Really great texture and flavor; probably the best tsukune I've had.
- Chicken skin (4/5)
- Chicken thigh (4/5) - Good chicken flavor and not dry.
- Scallops (4/5)
- Beef tongue (4/5) - Served as a plated dish with mushrooms and a garlic sauce. Might have preferred it as a skewer.
- Short rib (3/5) 
- Shishitos (4/5)
- Eggplant (3/5) 
- Pork belly (3/5) - Ours was burned unfortunately.

Overall, Noren was solid and definitely worth future visits, especially when we don't feel like driving out to Richmond and Sunset. With two cocktails and a beer, our check came out to be ~$110 pre tip.",4,0,2,1,1

"This place is delicious!

Went here with my family a few weekends ago. Everyone loved their burger!
They were perfectly cooked and nice and juicy.
We all had the aged angus beef burger and thought it was very tasty! 

We had also ordered some onion rings which were delicious as well!

The French frys are fabulous especially if you like to put them inside of your burger like I do. They are like thick cut potato chips, just not as crunchy through out. We loved them!

"Oh my! Hawaiian buns + hot dogs/ burgers?? And BEER?? I'm IN!!!!

So glad Dog Haus opened up in Belmont! It's in such a nice, mellow area too. I've been here about 4+ times and have always had a great experience! The customer service here is great too - the workers are friendly which makes the experience more enjoyable.

I have tried the Sooo Cali Haus Dog, Old Town Haus Dog, The Hangover Haus Burger - all made with very tasty ingredients and that amazing hawaiian bun! The menu makes it really easy to see what ingredients they have in each entree (if you don't like something, let them know and they could modify your order!). Their appetizers are really good and great to share with large groups. Side note: if you love spicy as much as I do, go check out the green sauce they have each their ketchup/ mustard and try that out! To lessen the spiciness, add some ketchup to the mix and you'll have bomb sauce to eat your food with. Trust me!

Their beer selection is fantastic as well - so many options to choose on tap that it gets overwhelming. Luckily the bartenders are nice and informative that they could give you good suggestions on what to drink depending on your liking... Or you could sample them :) 

They have a great happy hour menu from Sunday - Friday from 3pm-6pm that I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to grub with friends and family!",5,1,2,1,1
"We got here just in time. Sunday. Right at noon. Ordered. Sat down. Then BAM! Long line behind us!

I love that they have salad entrees! Perfect for keto and low-carb eaters. They also have vegan options!! We ordered:

Pork Chop Rice Plate
Grilled Pork Banh Mi
Combo Grill Salad
Brisket Pho

The serving sizes are huge and they don't skimp on meat or veggies. The food is delicious! The service is great. You order at the counter. Then they assign you a table. A few minutes later, someone is walking over with your food. It's pretty quick!

They have a self-service sauce bar and condiments, if you want extra. They also have boba! Can't go wrong at this restaurant. 

I would give them 6 stars because they have purse hooks under the tables!!!

The only comment I have is I wish the salad underneath my grilled meats was more integrated. I had pickled cabbage, carrots and cucumbers on one side. And then mixed greens on the other. I couldn't really dig in there and mix all my veggies because of all the meats. But I'm not complaining about that! Bring on the meat!!",5,0,0,1,1

"This place is special. If you have been to Rangoon Ruby then this is the similar kind of cuisine. 

The coconut curry noodle is unique. I had it before in Macao where there are a few Burmese restaurant. 

The fried rice was disappointing and will not order again but would like to try the briyani next time

The garlic noodle also disappointed. It lacks flavor. I don't think they do stir fry them in butter. And I don't like the type of noodle they use 

Palata was very good. 

I wasn't too crazy about the goat stew neither. 

The tea leaf salad was not the best I've had but it's very good already. It's a must try. 

The quail is ok. 

The samosa was also very good. Very flavorful.",4,0,2,0,1

Think of the worst critics you know ... I know a few who happen to be pretty good cooks/chefs always experimenting. And most the time, they blow my fun when trying new places with their critiques! So while I like this place for my own tastes and reasons, here's what they'll complain about:

Beef roll - Where's the beef??? Barely an ounce in there, 90% roll! Ya, well, I happen to like the salt and slightly sweet flavor of the roll! Not too concerned with the lack of beef.

Pork bun - So plain, nothing inside but a small piece of meat! It's ok, I like the bun.

"Very inviting atmosphere with classy and interesting decor, super friendly service, and delicious cocktails and food.

Came in on a Tuesday evening, and it was still busy! My bf and I were lucky enough to snag seats at the bar. We got a couple cocktails and shared a cheese plate and fish n chips.

Fish n chips: really big fillets! They definitely didn't skimp out on you. They're lightly breaded, so crispy on the outside, and moist inside. The chips/fries were hot and crispy, and on the fatter side (which I love). The mashed peas were sooo good. Everything on that plate was delicious. (5/5)

Cheese plate: great assortment and generous portion of cheeses! Love the flatbread crisps, slices of granny smith and honey to compliment the cheeses. (5/5)

Cocktails: all were 5/5.

I don't usually go to Sunnyvale (it's once in a blue moon-- in fact, the last time I was in downtown Sunnyvale was probably 4 years ago!), but I would totally come back here again in the future to try more cocktails and food.",5,4,6,5,1

"Few experiences embody Berkeley as much as my first time here yesterday. Let me explain... On an unassuming Tuesday evening, my seasoned Cheeseboard friends took me here after much build up. They were like Cheeseboard's hype women, and honestly, being with the right people to get you excited about food can make all the difference!

The band was fabulous, the weather was great, and I was the right amount of hungry to be eating half a pizza+. Good vibes all around. We found a place to stand-sit outside, then a guy with beachy blond waves rode by on his bike and gave me a poem. It was befuddling to be approached via bicycle, but I have to admit it's part of Berkeley's appeal. If you're reading this mystery verse man, keep the art alive.

In food-related commentary, we waited a total of maybe 2 mins to order and get our whole pizza. It was magical. Must have been record time from Oven to Mouth, considering the line is usually down the block, and my friends were pleasantly surprised too. It is well worth a longer wait anyway! Don't be discouraged like I was when I would try to go other times.

I'm a big fan of the one veggie pizza of the day phenomenon since my inability to choose from endless options usually gets the best of me. I also think people have qualms about pizzas being a certain way: no meat, no tomato sauce, why is there a lime wedge, etc, but Cheeseboard offers something new, refreshing, and simple, literally every single day. It doesn't get more American than this 8)

The day's pizza was an arugula w lemon vinaigrette, mushrooms, red onion, and PARM REG, which really won me over. An employee brought out a fresh bottle of the well-loved Papi Chulo salsa, a green cilantro + Serrano chile sauce that sits next to the counter. My friends recommended to pour it on the pizza slices for an added zing, and it's an amazing combination (on probably everything).

The whole experience was right out of a Berkelandia skit, and it surpassed my expectations which is hard to do with a place that is so hyped up. I'm a believer now.",5,6,8,6,1
"Back in the day when I was rockin' neon everything: t-shirt, tights, and scrunchie to hide my hideous $5 chinatown haircut that left me with a mullet...so instead of looking like D.J. Tanner, I looked like the AzN dwarf version of Uncle Jesse.

Anyhow, during those days, my mom would drag me to Lion Plaza nearly every weekend. I never understood WHY we would drive nearly an hour from SF to Man Jose for food and groceries. 

NOW, I do....

As an adult, I find myself going to Man Jose at least once a month to get my Vietnamese food fix.

Places like B������ N����� Phu Yen is WHY I love Yelp. 

If it weren't for Yelp, there's no way I would have ever found this place. If you've been to Lion Plaza, then you know that most of the people there are OGs who probably never even heard of Yelp. 

This is why I'm dedicating my 2,400 review (PHEW!) to B������ N����� Phu Yen for serving one of THE best dishes I've had in 2019!

Located in the food court of Lion Plaza, B��� ietnamese Steak & Eggs. The menu is in Vietnamese with no English translations. They have 20 other items on the menu like Ch�����o Vit (Porridge w/ duck), B������ L������c Lac (Shaking beef), B������ Kho (Beef Stew), Bot Chein (Pan fried Rice Cakes w/ eggs), Oc Len Sao Dua (Coconut snails), etc. 

I highly recommend the B������ N����� since this dish is their specialty and isn't easy to find, even in Man Jose.

Everything on the menu is under $16 and includes tax. CASH ONLY!!!

Place your order with the nice owner. He's fluent in Vietnamese and Cantonese, and can speak a little English. 

If you're ordering the B������ N�����, he'll ask you how you want it cooked. I requested it medium rare and he told me 7 minutes.

While waiting, I checked out the other food court vendors. Since I went early (9:45 am), there was no line and my order was ready in less than 7 minutes. 

As I carried the sizzling platter of B���� he B����""Steak & Eggs"": Filet Mignon w/ sunny-side up eggs, pate, french baguette, salad ($16 + $1 spam): https://bit.ly/31pN765

The marinated slices of filet mignon were incredibly soft and tender with a delicious savory sweetness from the oyster sauce. No knife needed...it's THAT soft. The filet is undercooked for medium rare which I prefer: https://bit.ly/33CbZcg. If you like your filet mignon less rare, just leave it on the sizzling platter to cook longer. 

Make sure to break the yolks and mix all that liquid gold into the buttery sauce...

Then, rip a piece of the toasted French baguette, dunk it into the sauce to soak up ALL that buttery deliciousness, and enjoy. 

AHHHHHHHHH, IT'S SOOOO BOMB! 

There's also dollop of pate for extra richness. 

It beats American Steak & Eggs on any day and it's cheap. The meal includes a side salad, pickled jalape�����os, and sate (chili sauce) to cut through all that richness. And, a cup of hot tea...for $16 out the door! 

I thought the spam wasn't really necessary especially wly get half a slice for $1 but hey, it's a only $1 and you're supporting a tiny mom and pop shop. 

The food court is dingy and still looks the same as when I frequented it in the 90s but you're here for the food, not for photo ops.

I've had this place bookmarked for months, but finally got the chance to come for dinner. Lucky we got there early because it filled up immediately after we were seated. There's a nice patio outside and they brought out a heater when it turned a little cold, which was nice. 

Our table ordered the lobster roll, fish and chips, some salads, the cheesy crab bread and the cioppino, all of which were delicious. 

The cheesy crab bread, I have to say, was completely wonderful. Took the rest home and had it for dinner the following night. Nice wait staff, reasonably easy to find location.

"Recently enjoyed a delicious salmon wrap at Mona's on Oak Grove. Good option for a day when you don't want one of Mona's great burgers or a salad.

The Mona's on Clayton Road is closer to my home, but I had a chance to visit the Oak Grove site with a friend.

They both have the same good menu and similar decor. However, the Oak Grove Mona's is smaller and somehow more comfortable and welcoming than Mona's on Clayton Road.

"In a previous life, I traveled extensively in Germany and Austria so I can vouch for the authenticity of Naschmarkt. It rivals the best meals I had while traveling. For those who were wondering, the restaurant is named after the largest open air produce market in Vienna, Austria. (Another place you should visit if you get a chance.)

But you're here for a food review, not travel guidance:

We ordered the smoked pork bratwurst as an appetizer but because we were celebrating my birthday, the waiter recommended we get a special cheese-filled brat instead. It was mild but well flavored -- the cheese was a taste accent and not overwhelming.

We also split a goat cheese purse salad with spinach. There was too much balsamic vinegar for our tastes. It turned out to be the only thing we didn't enjoy.

Both entrees were fantastic. The Hungarian beef goulash was hugely flavorful with tender chunks of beef. We got the sp�����tzle on the side or you could substitute roasted fingerling potatoes if you're gluten faily special was beef stroganoff and I'm glad I got it. It was rich and creamy and frankly if it hadn't been such a large portion, I would have eaten every bite. Luckily there was enough for lunch the next day.

For dessert we had a strawberry palatschinken, which was a daily special. This is a crepe filled with strawberry jam and topped with creme fraiche. Solid but not spectacular.

Since it was my birthday, they brought us a trio of sorbets. Despite the fact we were full, the sorbets disappeared.

Juan, our waiter, was friendly; he checked on us regularly without being intrusive. The host/owner stopped by to chat as well. The place definitely had a family feel and you could tell that there were quite a few regulars. Maybe we will be regulars as well.",4,0,0,0,1
"Surprisingly good. I went here during Oktoberfest and was looking for something with American food and some good keto options for my friend and I.

I have no idea what our servers/bartenders name was but service was good, he was pleasant, and bonus was funny.

We ate Brussel sprouts, Cesar salad, and lettuce wrapped burgers with side of tomato bisque. Everything was really good. Need to try more of their food but will definitely be coming back to the spot.",4,0,1,0,1
"Celebrity Maharashtrian Chef Vishnu Manohar from Nagpur and Pune brings this authentic experience from the Maharashtrian heartlands to Sunnyvale. Just my luck that I happened to be visiting Sunnyvale this week and got to meet him and sample his robust lunch buffet. 

Mahrashtrian cuisine unlike it's North Indian counterparts (the eponymous butter chicken and chicken tikka masala) consists of a lot of hearty vegetables, lentils, a chickpea flour curry called ""kadhi"" that's typically eaten with a fragrant ""khichdi"" (soft lentil rice combination with ghee) and a range of rotis and assorted peanut and chilli chutneys. Vishnuji brings all this and more to the table at a very reasonably priced $11.99 buffet. 

The food is light and mildly flavored depending on the dish, so it's not a one-note experience. On Wednesday I got the chance to taste potato bhajiyas (fritters), moong dal, kadhi, khichdi, potatoes cooked in a soft mushy style to be eaten with puris, sev chi bhaji and sooji halwa. What a spread it was ... just like back home. And to end it all, you can make your own paan! 

Side note: My friend didn't partake the lunch buffet and ordered sabudana wadas and pav bhaji from the ala carte menu and both were excellent as well - the wadas in particular were done just right. 

Service was prompt and buffet dishes were being filled regularly during my weekday lunch visit. I understand it's vegetarian only for now with plans to add non vegetarian dishes in the coming few weeks.",5,9,14,14,1
"Super cute restaurant that makes for a nice intimate dinner. While they only have a couple of tables inside, there are several more on their back patio which is romantically decorated with lights strewn about. I would advise either making reservations if you can - it took over 20 minutes for a table of 2 and they don't do to go orders during dinnertime. 

Once we got seated, the hostess gave us a run down of the menu and gave us some of her favorite recommendations. Even though their apps looked tasty, we decided to skip this portion and went straight for the mains. I got the roasted chicken while my husband got the prime bavette. My chicken was made absolutely perfectly - super juicy with two big portions of meat on the plate. I didn't like the sides as much - the swiss chard with marbled potatoes left a little to be desired but at least the protein was on point. My husband enjoyed his steak as well although he ended up not being full after (he has a big appetite) and had to go and grab some snacks somewhere else afterwards. 

Both their food and lunch menu are pretty limited here so don't come here with the perception that you'll have a large variety to choose from, but at least the options they do have, they do well. I would recommend coming to Ambrose if you're in the mood for a good meal with good service and a warm ambience.",4,0,1,0,1

I usually get the mixed (drumsticks & wings) at half soy garlic and half spicy soy garlic. IT'S SO GOOD. Crispy skin & juicy meat. What more can you ask for?

"I came here as part of a group of 11 to celebrate Women's Day. Because obviously spicy food shows you appreciate women. Obviously.

Anyway, apparently this place is having a soft opening, but the owner is well known and there has been a lot of anticipation regarding this spot. As we had a large group, we tried to make a reservation. Unfortunately, we called at 11:40, and the best they could do was 1 pm.

So we wait, and wait, and then finally leave, and we arrive, and the place is beyond packed. There are people milling around the whole place, you can barely stand without brushing elbows. And our table is nowhere near ready.

1:15 comes and goes, there are no tables.

1:30, still no tables. Some of our group are getting antsy.

1:45, still no tables. One of our group gets milk tea next door, another decides to do some shopping at Safeway nearby.

2:15, after waiting over an hour, we are mercifully seated.

At this point I was beyond hungry, beyond even hangry, and well into a delusional state of ""PLEASE GOD JUST FEED ME SOMETHING"". Despite that, Shang's delivered big time.

As soon as we were seated, dish after dish after spicy, flavorful dish came. And kept coming. And then more came after that! You can see most of the dishes in my photos. The person who ordered was a bit overzealous in his desire to celebrate women, and I would guess we had about 18 dishes total. And yes, 18 dishes is a bit too much for 11 people.

I'd love to detail everything we got, but to be honest the combination of starvation a extremely fast meal service means a lot of the food sort of blends together in my mind. I will say the Dan Dan Mein was great, the spiciest of the dishes, with great texture and depth of flavor. The Mapo Tofu was also great; unlike most places, the sauce was minimal and the tofu was firm enough to pick up with chopsticks.

There were a few less-than-stellar dishes, which may be due to the soft opening. We ordered this one noodle dish that was just dripping with oil and soy sauce, and was difficult to eat. Also, we ordered 2 dishes with intestines, and hey, Mr. Shang, quick tip - please wash your intestines just a bit more. While tolerable, I would say someone who hasn't had intestine before is going to have trouble eating these since the ""barnyard flavor"", as Andrew Zimmern puts it, was quite pronounced.

Oh and the bill was $380. Not expensive considering the quality, freshness, and variety of a lot of the dishes, but not cheap either. 

So overall, my take is this is a bit pricey, the food is mostly good with only a few missteps, and it's a great way to experience a more authentic type of Chinese food than most places. Granted, this food would be decidedly average were it served in China, but for the Bay Area, it's going to be hard to find anything better.",4,3,5,0,1
"This review is long over-due. Jack's is located at the Corner of Ygnacio Valley and Oak grove road at ""The Orchards"" Shopping Plaza in Walnut Creek.

This place is amazing in many ways. Fresh ingredients, affordable prices for a meal and friendly customer service. I have dined in here a few times and have ordered takeout several times.

They have the BEST fresh carved meats. A whole fresh turkey, Chicken and Prime Rib. They carve the meat in front of you (made to order) and its piping hot. Aint nothing up in here microwaved! You can either get a plate, salad or sandwich. They have soup selections too. You don't have to wait for Thanksgiving to have your home cooked turkey and mash on the side! Comfort food at its best! 

My favorite is the build your own salad which you can choose 6 fresh toppings and the dressing of your choice *without any protein added*. The salad is a enough to have for leftovers the next day. The ingredients taste fresh and everything is seasoned well.The salad comes to less than $10 dollars which is always a winner in my book. 

And dare not the order the mouth watering cartwheel flipping socks almost falling off your freshly pedicured feet Urban Fries which come drizzled with the BEST spicy chili oil topped with blue cheese and chili flakes. I mean who wants plain boring fries? These fries are so so good! I have to control myself and only order the half size. The garlic fries are bomb too but the Urban Fries took it home for the win baby.

Parking is plentiful, they have a clean facility with a nice restroom.

The staff is young so make sure you state what you would like to order clearly and double check your order for accuracy. I had a little hiccup with a missing item, but it was settled amicably. I would recommend this place to everyone! Oh and they have the best strawberry lemonade!",5,2,4,7,1

"Came here on a Saturday night because of 2 reasons: Gavin wanted a burger for dinner and I wanted to check this place out. I've been to their other location w/ my ex months ago and remembered how delicious the food was. The other/original location is located inside Sideline Sports Bar and Grill. 

I haven't eaten anything all day. I was busy running errands plus I am doing IF so I dragged it out to as long as I could. Parking is horrible because there isn't any. The parking lot by the restaurant is for Round Table customers. I didn't want to park and risk having my car towed but we eventually found parking on the street. 

Walked in and was greeted right away. Such a friendly and welcoming vibe. I wasn't in the greatest mood but being here w/ my little one lifted my spirits. Here's what we ordered: Beef Short Rib Poutine, Philly Steak Melt, and for Gavin The Farmburger (added cheese). Each entree comes w/ steak fries but I substituted his fries for onion rings. We didn't wait too long.. the music was on and there was a lot to awe at; the decor is crazy and fun. 

Only con: they have Pepsi products only but I loved how my Diet Pepsi was refilled w/o me having to ask. Our food was brought out and we both couldn't wait to dig in after I snapped photos for Yelp. They forgot his onion rings but they apologized and brought a fresh order out w/in minutes.. fried perfectly (yes, I stole a few). 

My Philly Melt was delicious.. I saved half for the next day only to find out Gavin stole it. He liked it, too. He enjoyed his cheese burger and ate most of his fries and onion rings. The poutine was good.. the short rib was very flavorful but it needed more cheese curds (just my opinion). I'd def. try the other poutines. 

Thank you for a wonderful experience. Gavin was given a sticker and he placed it on the lockers in the bathroom which was very clean.

We have been here 3x already. They got rid of the onion rings as a side which means it's less money and calories spent for me then.",5,9,15,13,1
"We came here on a Wednesday night it was pretty empty and from the looks of this place you might not want to go out here for a fancy dinner date haha.

We had the drunken noodle and the chicken with green beans, it has to one of the most delicious Thai food I've had. Do not be fooled by its decorations or location. The only reason I deducted one star was because of the interior look, it almost feels like you want to get up and start cleaning parts of the restaurant yourself. I might be coming back in the future but just to take away not sit in.",4,0,1,0,1
"I have been meaning to try this place as soon as they opened. I finally got to go this past weekend and it was everything I wanted it to be. Remember I am saying this as a non--filipino person so I do not mean to offend. The decor was tasteful and their drink menu was extensive. Their cocktails cost anywhere from 11-13 dollars depending on what is in it. The use a lot of dried fruit in their drinks which is great because those flavors slowly infuse into your drink giving you different levels as time goes by. Here are the food items you MUST TRY. 

1. Pork Adobo (the second kind with coconut milk) it is different and super flavorful. you will not get that much pork in it so its perfect for 2-3 people to share and have a taste. 
2. Shangai lumpia- SO CRUNCHY, SO GOOD, with actual filling you can taste
3. RIBS- this is under the apps list, but theres quite a few ribs on there for you to try
4. DESSERT: TARON- so crispy and has the right amount of sweetness

Side note: They have a parking lot, but it fills up quick, street parking is your best bet.",4,1,4,1,1

"Overall I had a wonderful dinner here with a few friends and I was pretty impressed. We walked from the student housing on the south side of Berkeley and it wasn't too bad of a walk. There didn't seem to be a wait when we got there, but we also had a reservation so we were seated right away. 

The food selection was a pretty classic Italian menu, the only thing I felt they were missing was a good meatless option. Usually I can find something substantial without meat, but the only option here were the shells (which were amazing, but not really my speed). We got a few orders of the zucchini fritters for the table and they were amazing, super savory and fluffy! I ordered the caesar salad and the broccolini side and other than the salad being a little but on the salty side, both were very good. 

My group also tried the ricotta-stuffed shell, the dry-aged T-bone steak, and some sort of ravioli with sage sauce. No complaints about the mains. 

I think that dessert was really the star of the show. We had the panna cotta, the cherry sundae, and the affogato. The cherry sundae was classic and delicious, also not too heavy after all that great food! The espresso was good, and so was the panna cotta, although I don't think I would order them again myself. 

Overall I recommend Corso if you are looking for great food in a lively, more upper scale environment. Amazing food, and not too snobby!!!",4,0,0,0,1

"Came here last night for some tacos after the gym and I'm so happy I did! Apple maps will guide you wrong and the sign says la costa on it. I ended up turning into a KFC but it's just across the street from it. It's kind of set up like a drive-in and has only outdoor seating.

I thought they had seafood tacos but they don't so I just got chicken tacos with sour cream. Make sure to bring cash because this place does not take credit cards! For us, 6 tacos came out to about $13! 

We got our food pretty quickly and they even threw in a free horchata which was really nice. It was honestly soooo good. They warm the tortilla as well so it gives you a little bit of crunch. I really liked the salsa they added to the taco and the chicken was seasoned very well. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good tacos that are quick! Just don't forget to bring cash",5,3,1,1,1

The woman taking our order was kind and their service is super fast! The inside decor has Frida Kahlo's everywhere and makes me overjoyed with happiness because Frida is one of my favorite human beings and a huge inspiration to me. 

So about the food... I treated my b to a large dinner of a carne asada burrito, torta with pollo asado, two pupusas (one with pork and one with black beans and cheese), and topped it off with tres leches cake. We split everything and jammed!! We both died over the burrito, the torta was my favorite, and the pupusas were delicious! My b loves tres leches cake and I'm not even a big tres leches fan but we both LOVED it!! We were completely stuffed to the brim after.

The lamb fell of the bone and was seasoned beautifully. It was accompanied by herb gnocchi which was perfect. A wonderful Fall dish. The pork tenderloin in hand wrapped tortellini was exquisite.

It's a large restaurant over looking the water. The tables are pretty close together but the view made up for it. They offered us regular menus, a seasonal menu, and a kids menu for our son. 

We decided to order the crab ceviche appetizer. It was good because it was different. It wasn't your typical citrusy and acidic ceviche. It was prepared with coconut milk so it was creamy. It was very flavorful and fresh. 

For our entrees, we split the cioppino and the mixed grill plate. The cioppino was very good. Spicy broth and lots of fresh seafood. The mixed grill had shrimp skewers, salmon, and cod. It had really good flavor and was fresh. It was served with mashed potatoes and green beans. 

For dessert, we ordered the apple walnut one. It was crunchy on top with oatmeal and had a scoop of ice cream on top.

"$3 papusas and tacos! I checked out this new place in a relatively nondescript strip mall not far from home one Friday for lunch. At 11:30a, all was pretty quiet in the restaurant (I think I was the first lunch customer). A nice husband and wife team took my order and started the food prep (everything is made to order). I think it took about 20 mins or so for my order to be ready, so next time, I'll definitely call head when getting takeout. I figured I'd order one papusa and one taco to get a feel for the food here. The chicken taco was super flavorful (great chicken meat!) as was the bean & cheese papusa. 

The restaurant is very clean and seems like a good place to dine in, as well (my order was to-go for lunch this time). It looks like you get free chips & salsa if you dine in. I'll definitely be back since the food was really fresh and tasty - the jalapeno & cheese papusa is on my list for next time!

"*Vegetarian 30-Day Challenge review 6 of 30*

This national, Cali-based chain�������with nearly 40 locations and counting�������has done its part to try to bring vegan into the mainstream American diet.

Their Far East Bowl ($12) w/ sesame-crusted chickin' has a nice satisfying crunch, and honestly tastes and loo""chicken"" is a combination of veggie proteins (soy, wheat, and peas) and has a near perfect texture. The rest of the bowl was just ok, but that chickin' will have me coming back time and again.

"Thai Love You, Thai Love You too!

I originally was looking for a Thai restaurant that served larb, but to my surprise I didn't see it on the menu. However, it didn't stop me from wanting to try everything else they had on their menu.

The place is very small with only a few tables inside and a couple outside. My friend and I were able to snag a table inside, and then there were people who had to wait. This was a Wednesday night.

Between my friend and I, we decided on the pad see ew with chicken and the pineapple curry with prawns (which was one of their specials on the back of the menu). The spice levels are mild, medium, hot and very hot. We went with medium on the noodle dish and mild on the curry. They don't skimp out on their spice levels so medium had a pretty good kick to it. 

Both dishes came out presented beautifully. The pad see ew noodles were all coated in it's delectable sauce. Not too salty - which is generally what happens. Pieces of chicken were more tender than most places, and overall, you could taste the quality upgrade in this dish.

The pineapple curry had six pieces of very plump, fresh shrimp (delicious!). I also liked the chunks of pineapple which added some sweetness to the curry. It was smooth and the coconut milk was so fragrant. Overall, another beautiful dish with quality ingredients and taste.

The price point here is higher than most Thai restaurants. On the other hand, the price reflects the trade-off you have with quality of ingredients and presentation. Portion size was decent, though I do feel like other places would give more. After tip, the total bill for the two entrees was $42. 

It was nice trying ""higher"" quality Thai food. It was a nice change of pace to have ""nicer"" dining. However, price and portion size may steer me to other places. The service here was very attentive. They are friendly and the place is intimate so they want to make sure you're taken care of. Water was always topped off and plates were taken accordingly. 

I would recommend it if you want to treat yourself a bit. But if you're looking to save some bucks, I would wait for a different day to come here.",4,7,10,11,1
"Fuego Fuego Fuego. I didn't even know there was a cajun seafood spot here until after I walked out of Target one day and noticed a recenlty opened cajun food spot in the plaza. Being a person who loves to try every cajun spot in the area, I had to come back another night to try Shell Shock.

To my surpise Shell Shock is actually pretty good. The service was great, the shrimp / crawfish were a good size. They were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing when you dipped it in the house special sauce. The Cajun fries were also delicious it came out along with the rest of the food and man were they crispy and addictive when you dip them in the sauce. Looking back at the menu I noticed they had lemon pepper tossed fries so I definitely gotta try those next time i stop by!

"I found this hidden Castro Valley gem today and really loved it! I came here to order a late, to-go lunch. It was surprisingly busy for an off hour (around 3pm). For lunch I decided to go with the eggplant plate and a hot pink chai (which I saw was quite popular in other Yelp reviews). 

After ordering I sat down on one of the comfy chairs. It's a cute little spot to get some work done on the laptop or have a casual meal with a friend. The wait was a little long but they were busy so it's understandable (call ahead for to-go orders if you're in a rush). 

The food was really tasty and had a nice mix of spices. It was a big portion with rice, eggplant infused with tomato and spices, a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side, some sliced pita bread, green sauce, and tzatziki. The pink chai was untraditional: very unique and had a nice, subtle but sweet taste.. a good change from regular chai and perfect for a cold day. I would like to try their spiced chai next time.

The bibimbap was great. I liked the crispy rice at the bottom fro the hot stone. Came with a nice portion of tender pork. 

The fried chicken comes with either spicy sauce or a sweet sauce. The spicy is not that hot and I preferred that to the sweet sauce. They were nicely battered but not as crispy as Bowl'd BBQ, which I prefer. The table next to us ordered the seafood pancake which looked amazing.

The savory mantu was also delicious. We sampled a variety of their meats and they were grilled to perfection. The Shami (ground beef) kebabs were so tender and flavorful. The chicken and steak were both juicy. The chapli was the only one that could have been better. It tasted very similar to the shami kebab and I was expecting more herbs and seasoning.

"Wifey and I were in the area during a Monday. Our previous Chicken and Rice experience in Seattle was really good so decided to give this place a go. We were not disappointed. 

The menu is quite limited, which I don't mind. Focus on making a few dishes great. Totally get it. Wife ordered the #1 Kao mun gai. I went with the purple sticky rice and fried chicken, mainly because I didn't want to dupe my wife. We also shared a sticky rice with mango for dessert and I had a Thai iced tea. 

The kao mun gai is poached chicken served with rice cooked in I think chicken broth and comes with a dipping sauce. The chicken and rice was very tasty, with or without the sauce. I'd say it's definitely the dish to get. 

The fried chicken was fine. It's one of those safe dishes that can't really go wrong. The purple rice though, which looked more blue, was on the dry side. In hindsight, I should have gone with the regular rice. 

The mango and sticky rice was ok. Mango wasn't that great, but then I don't suppose mangoes are in season in the winter so can't really fault them for that. 

Overall I'd definitely recommend checking this place out and go with the #1.",4,0,1,3,1

Probably wouldn't recommend that dish.

I think the server could have been a bit more engaging. And at $18 for garlic noodles, I think the serving size could have been a bit bigger. But, those garlic noodles were the star of the night and should be a MUST get! Get 2 of it, or maybe even 3 of it and forget the kobe dish.",4,0,1,1,1

"This place is just damn good. The sandwiches are good, the salads are good, and the cookies are SO GOOD. The bread is SO GOOD. Just go eat there! :D 
Oh, and all salads come with bread, so you still get the good bread. I just don't even know what else to say, you should just go eat there.
If you order online and then go in to pick it up, just grab it at the register - I've stood near the pickup area for a while before realizing that. Online orders go to the register, in-person orders go to the order pick up area. Just a hot tip to make your experience smoother. I'm off to go get myself a sandwich now.",5,1,1,1,1
"I am a big fan of this place! 

I love sitting at the bar and ordering drinks and apps. Bars and tables are the best, although they do have some couches by the entrance which is good if you're there for a drink. 

The staff is very friendly and nice, they always great drinks and good suggestions. 

The food is really delicious, I have never had anything I didn't love. The artichoke app is my favorite but really, anything with chicken is amazing!

I have only gone in the evening, usually later and each time it's radically different. Full bar and restaurant and other times quiet and busy but not too busy. 

I think it's well worth trying! 

Pros:
Wine flights
Nice staff
Excellent food

Cons:
Parking (but that's really anywhere in Walnut Creek)",5,1,1,1,1
"I had drunken noodles and pineapple fried rice here, and they were both pretty decent. Pineapple fried rice was not spicy ordinarily, but they were able to make it spicy for me. It was a great. 

The inside of the restaurant is fairly cavernous, and has several different compartments- sorta like a mystery house. I believed the structure was converted from a residential house, but not 100% sure. And it still retained that original floor plan.

Overall a fairly unique eatery, one of a kind. Unfortunately it only opens for dinner.",4,0,0,0,1
"Tasty reasonably priced Greek eats on the east end of Solano.

We ordered lamb and chicken souvlaki, dolmas, hummus, and some garlic fries.
The first thing my wife and I noticed was the lack of grease in traditionally oily dishes. Even the dolmas could be picked up without leaving a sheen on your fingers.

Over all the food was fresh and appetizing, and everything was well priced, as the portions were plentiful. The hummus was especially nicely sour and slightly grainy. Next time we're back, we'll try the moussaka for sure!",4,0,0,0,1
"Food here is pretty good. We ordered a variety of meat and carbs. The best is definitely the beef + onion wraps! A must try :) 

More of a to go place vs a sit down place (even though there is seating outside) mainly because parking is difficult and there is only 15 minute parking in the lot nearby. 

We will definitely be back again.",5,2,3,2,1
"So nostalgic! Classic childhood snacks stacked in the middle of the spot. Chinese drama pop songs playing in the background. Delicious Taiwanese food to hit the spot. This was exactly what I was looking for. 

We ordered the lu rou fan, napa cabbage stew (with egg) and the beef noodle soup. The lu rou fan was perfectly fatty. The beef noodle soup was warm and soothing for the cold windy day. The cabbage stew was perfect to offset the saltiness of the other two dishes. I could have that stew all day everyday! 

Will be back next time I'm in SF!",5,0,0,0,1
"If you like roasted chicken, this is your place. Famous for its whole chicken, Zuni is a good restaurant to go to for a nice dinner. 

The cocktails here are great, I quite enjoyed the Pamplemousse. We also started with a sampling of west coast oysters, and you could really taste the difference in each one, they were very fresh. 

Next I had the polenta, which was only okay.

Finally, after the long wait, our chicken came out. Is it worth all the hype? Maybe not. There isn't a single dry piece of meat on it, which is impressive, but to me, it tasted like any other chicken. The real star of the show is the bread underneath the chicken. There are large chunks of bread, almost crouton-like, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. It's soaked with all the juices from the chicken, and the flavor is amazing. If I could just order that bread I would. 

Overall, for special occasions, Zuni is a good place to go.",4,2,1,0,1
"The hype is deserved! 

I'm readying myself to leave the Cool, Grey City of Love and feeling the push/pull of finding reasons to stay and reasons to go.

Cross off the bucket list a banh mi from Saigon Sandwich, a must-try if you live here.

Crunchy French bread that has some give and the right amount of chew, roasted pork, sliced jalape�����o (with a few seeds intact for a spicy kick), cilantro, pickled onions, carrots plus a tranche of p�����t�����.

I underestimated how filling it would be; I handed off the last half to the trash compactor (my child). 

Two huge sandwiches, bag of shrimp chips, container of 10-12 little madeleines, a Yoo-hoo! and (probably the best) Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had - all for $20.50.

You can get pork, meatball, pork & pate or roasted chicken banh mi. It's strictly a grab 'n' go spot.

The neighborhood is dicey, it's the Tenderloin. Be aware of your surroundings & you'll be fine.

Close to the Federal Building, the Asian Art Museum, The Maia reason not to dread jury duty?) 

Do NOT forget to get a Viet iced coffee!",5,18,29,27,1
"Pizza so good that I finished my entire Pinsa deserves 5 stars!! My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here. We chose this restaurant because of all the great reviews and because it's within walking distance to the Orpheum. The interior is rustic and casual. It was full at 5pm with many people headed to a show or having just watched one. I would definitely recommend reservations.

We started with two appetizers. The Crudo di Zucchine had ribbons of green and yellow zucchini with almonds, ricotta and mint. It was light and refreshing. The porchetta was tender, meaty and flavorful.

The Pinsas!! My husband and I each had our own. The crust is thin and crispy but still has a wonderful chew to it. The oven must be hot because parts of the crust have a nice char and parts of the crust puff up. I enjoyed my Pinsa with all veggies-tomatoes, zucchini, red pepper and eggplant. My husband loved the flavor of his with guanciale, tomato, red onion, pecorino and spicy peppers.

We ended our meal with a spicy chocolate mousse. It was chocolaty with a mild heat. Delicious meal and I would recommend this place especially if you enjoy a good pizza!!",5,1,3,3,1
"First time I've tried this place was when my mom's friend ordered it togo to my house and wow... I have been obsessed ever since! I come here whenever I am craving shrimp because their sauces are sooooo yummy. I honestly can say this place beats Boiling Crab, Kickin Crab, Clawshack, and Crawdaddy. I've been a customer here since they first opened and I noticed that this place has been better more popular as days go by and I'm so happy! 

They have two different sauces, Original Louisiana or Sweet California. I like to go with original Louisiana because I love the sauce. I have yet to try the sweet California but I will next time I come here! Let me tell you, they don't play around with the spice. Medium to me is what you would get 3rd level spicy at BC. Sometimes the shrimp is over cooked here but damn.. it's worth it to be because of the sauce LOL. Garlic noodles are also yummy. It's definitely garlic-y but could be more buttery? 

Customer service here is so good! The server tonight was so nice to us. Kept refilling our water, asking how our food was. One thing that did happen was the table who came after us received their food first so I'm guessing the kitchen forgot about our shrimp so the server noticed it right away and apologized for the inconvenience and got our food coming out in less than 5 minutes. 

Not only do they sell seafood here, but also rice food and soup! My boyfriend didn't want to eat shrimp because it was too fattening especially with the sauce so he went with the Beef w Rice and it was very well seasoned. I wish they made Beef pasta here too.",5,0,1,0,1
"Came with my family as I was passing by a few days ago. Food was amazing and drinks were just as good! The beef and cheese empanadas were amazing appetizers and the rotisserie chicken was super juicy. My favorite was the Arroz con Maricscos, no doubt the best dish to me, great flavors and very filling. The non alcoholic chica morada is to die for, I love alcholic drinks but a great nonalcoholic is rare. 

Server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Can't wait to be back with more friends.",5,0,2,2,1
"Been to Primavera Ristorante a handful of times and each visit has been marvelous.
We always try to grab seats at the bar as we feel there's more action. Plus, the bartender is fantastic! Major points for his excellent memory as well.

I almost always order the Clams Antipasto to start and stick with the Carbonara for my main. I have never, ever been disappointed by either dish. The carbonara is quite filling and the noodles are always al dente, as they should be.
During our most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Piccata and was worried that I would regret not ordering the carbonara.
Thankfully, the chicken piccata satisfied my craving for Italian food! It was exactly what I needed..... bow tie pasta, mixed in with plenty of capers, all dancing around in a lemony, citrusy, buttery sauce. YUM! I may have left a few crumbs on my plate =)
Sadly, I don't remember what my husband ordered as I was too involved with my food. However, he did mention that his dish was delicious, too.

The bartender is great and creates drinks based on what you like / don't like. AND..... the watermelon lime iced tea is a magnificent thirst quencher.

We believe Primavera Ristorante is a great neighborhood restaurant. It's consistently busy with many customers and we'll continue to keep this place in our dinner rotation.",4,2,3,1,1
"I have to say this, I'm in love with the the food here. I grew up working in an Italian restaurant in Santa Clara that closed down a number of years ago. Finally getting to taste some authentic Italian cuisine, was a breathe of fresh air. WE HAD EVERYTHING... the lasagna, the baked rigatoni, all of the pastas with shrimp, the salmon, the king crab with pasta was so creamy and delicious, and the Simi, cabernet sauvignon paired beautifully with everything. My mom doesn't drink, and actually had two glasses of wine with her meal. We started off with the calamari (tentacles too, yum) breaded evenly and oh so crunchy. My grandmother is older and doesn't come out much, while in town from Mexico she joined us here. I've never seen her eat so much in my life (the chicken fingers are her favorite). 

NOT TOO MENTION... THE AMAZING STAFF.
Christina is wonderful. Her smile, her presence was so positive and inviting. Charlie helped out, so did Bonita and Mike started us off perfectly. There are many more people but I didnt get their names. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. We kept adding tables and more food and it was all brought out perfectly. Thank you so much.",5,1,2,1,1

We ordered the Korean Fried Chicken - Garlic Soy (whole). It came out super fast!! It was pretty crunchy which I looove. The sauce we got was ok, I could've been happy w/ ketchup. There's Korean potato salad + pickled radish included. They also give you these wet toilette to use after you're finished eating!

Overall, I'll def come back for the KFC but would get the half size. The whole was more than enough for two people! I want to try the lunch box and rice cake next time.",4,0,1,2,1

"Mama Cho's BBQ is a located inside the Lake Chabot Public Market. Once inside, you can't miss it. In addition to food items, they also have a refrigerated section with Korean snacks and drinks. Customer service is patient, helpful, and friendly. 

I opted for the Korean burrito with short ribs, which ended up costing $14 (additional fee for the short ribs plus tax). The burrito comes with guacamole, salsa, garlic rice, black beans, and kimchi. I recommend adding some gochujang sauce for additional spice and to enhance the flavor. 

Came back a second time and got Mama Cho's Nachos with spicy pork. Pretty good. 

It's a little pricy, but if I need my Korean food fix, this place is definitely on my radar. I would love to come back and try their kalbi burger and their sweet potato tots. Until next time!",4,7,9,12,1
"Important to note: didn't eat here, just grabbed to-go. To go in mah belly!

My Bun Tom was such a refreshing and enjoyable chow session, sitting in my hotel room, looking out at the bay. For me, Vietnamese and Thai cuisine simply match the city of SF better than other dishes, can't nail down why this is, but I think it has to do with all of the walking. All of the walking! Don't get me wrong, I'm all about hitting 10,000 steps before noon, but that means I need to be eating light, protein powered fare that packs plenty of bright flavor in every bite. T������n Vietnamese did so in spades.

I will definitely be coming back!",5,2,8,4,1
"I had nachos here with the spicy chicken, and it's really good. Portion is good. Flavor is there, but it's not overly salty like the food at other Mexican taquerias.

"Family owned and operated business delivering a simple great tasting island style barbecue. 

Ordered the lunch special that came with bbq chicken, kalua (tender shredded and seasoned) pork, white rice, and a cucumber salad on the side. The chicken had great flavor, and they work hard to cook all of the chicken fresh right next to the food truck. The pork also had a great flavor to it. The cucumber salad was fresh and crisp. 

The portion sizes were generous for the price. The family was very friendly and served the food quickly. I'd surely eat here again.",4,1,1,1,1
"Took my mom out for her birthday to one of her favorite local spicy restaurants. 

I'm a sucker for spicy fish fillet and this place knocked it out of the park. The dish is HUGE by the way so it's enough for 2-3 people (maybe add an appetizer if you have 3+ people). I saw some people order one dish and eat by themsves. They appeared to have plenty of leftover. 

I love sweet and salty. So the spicy fried sesame balls were the perfect spicy mochi balls I never knew I needed.

"The masala dosa is so delicious! I like that the crepe is a little thicker than the typical dosa. It has an excellent crunchiness that is very satisfying, slightly reminiscent of the burnt rice bottom of the korean hot stone bibimbap dish.

Lentil soup was tasty as well.

Service was excellent and environment is relaxing and is more like an upscale diner.",5,1,1,1,1

"If a restaurant has got me and my husband battling over the last bite, that restaurant is a certified winner in my eyes -- Golden Crab takes the crown. 

My husband and I ordered the peppercorn crab, garlic noodles, and a bowl of white rice. My salivary glands are reactivating as I write this review. Wowzaaaa --- that crab was so salty and peppery. Definitely paired well with white rice to balance the strong flavors. The garlic noodles were a hefty size and reasonable price. We also ordered two glasses of wine. While the wine is clearly nothing special, I still grant it five stars given the value you pay. 

The restaurant itself is clean, airy, and large, making it great for large groups. It seemed to be quite the family-friendly kind of restaurant. 

Now, towards the end of dinner, I knew my stomach couldn't tolerate more food, but maaaan this dinner was bomb. We stuffed our faces till the last bite. Hands down will have to make my way back here again -- this time with an even emptier stomach.",5,0,0,0,1

"We enjoyed a casual and inexpensive lunch here with family members a few weeks ago. The in-laws are regulars here so they were in charge of ordering, I only requested pho and hubby wanted fried egg rolls. 

A lot of food started to show up shortly after the ordering, we were pleasantly surprised by the large amount/variety of fresh vegetables and rice papers served with the house specials. The egg roll wrappers were not the flaky/crispy kind rather a little on the chewing side which grandma seemed to enjoy better. The assortments of grilled meat, shrimp, fish cake and etc were all pretty good, stir fried tofu with broccoli was good as well. The pho however was not as memorable probably because it was already cold when we got to it. 

We all ate a lot and still some leftovers, less then $20 pp including tax and tips; even the normally frugal grandma thought it was a great deal. :)

Getting it extra hot was a pretty serious amount of heat that I think most people wouldn't be able to handle. I've had a few hotter things in my life but really very few. But sheer heat isn't the goal, it's heat plus flavor and the goat curry, despite being a volcano, still tasted excellent. You could still taste it through the spice and that isn't a given.

Anyways, it's good and believe their representations about the heat of their food.",4,2,5,2,1
"I was so excited when I learned there was a spicy pot restaurant in San Francisco - I was in Singapore earlier this year, and mala was one of my favorite foods there. 

You choose a protein, a flavor, a spice level, and extra add-ons, and they cook it all together with a bunch of those delicious spices. Even the medium size is a TON of food and could easily be shared by 3-4 people. I went with one other person, and we had leftovers for dinner the next day. I don't think the side dishes add too much to the dish, since it already comes with a ton of bean sprouts, veggies, and potato, but I would definitely recommend adding enoki. For protein, we chose lamb, and the pot came with a large amount of it. Do be warned that the lamb is very fatty and has much skin and cartilage, if you aren't into that.

If you don't like spice or don't like mala spice, this place probably isn't for you, but the mild spice option is quite tolerable, so don't be too put off.",5,0,2,0,1
"The boss said she wanted Q and we were close to Slow Hand so it wasn't much of a decision to make. We've always had good experiences with Slow Hand. 

Today, being Friday, they offered 8oz and 12oz Smoked Prime Rib with one side. I ordered the 12 oz, rare with a fully loaded Baked Potato ($1). The flavor was great but unfortunately, the meat was sinewy and chewy. 

We also got a full slab of St. Louis Ribs. Those were pretty tender as they usually are. 

We added on a 1/2lb of Juicy Brisket. Where the fat was, it was certainly juicy. Where the fat wasn't, the meat tended to be a bit dry. A few drops of BBQ sauce helped. 

The baked potato was as expected. The Garden Potato Salad was okay but didn't seem as good as on previous visits. Not sure why. 

I ordered a 10oz beer which was very good. Unfortunately, it came in what looked like a small wine glass with a small diameter base and a wider bowl making it top heavy. When I was reaching for paper towels, I hit the top of the glass and of course, it tipped over. Since I was the klutz, I just cleaned up the mess. It was quite refreshing to my leg and feet. 

We're still fans of Slow Hand. Hopefully today was just a glitch. The place was full when we arrived and packed when we left. A good reason not to dine there on a Friday night.",4,1,2,1,1

While looking for places to have dinner I came across and ""new"" spot which happened to be a Thai resto in the Concord area.

Walking in, I noticed the place looked a lot familiar to a Thai restaurant that used to take its place. From the looks of it, it looks like a whole new management and restaurant took over.

**PROs: New ownership and a slight revamping of the interior. Menu with lots of pictures and new Thai dishes I have never tried before. 

**CONs: A little slow in service, but this can certainly improve with time and more experience.

Chicken coconut soup- warm and hearty

Came here on a Friday night to wine and dine with my best friend and the restaurant was pretty packed. We had a reservation so it did not take long for us to get seated. The servers were prompt and came to our table to get us started. We opted in for my favorite for starters- the imperial rolls, very crispy and the ingredients are always fresh, then follow by some entrees to share! We got the BBQ ribs which were delicious and pretty tender. The lemongrass herb halibut was amazing and it brings out the good flavoring they had for the fish.

"I wanted to treat the fam to a nice dinner since I got a bonus, and for some reason I have been wanting to come to A Bellagio, but never had the chance to.

Made reservations for an early Friday evening, and although everyone was in a bit of a mood, the food quickly cheered us up! Our waiter was nice and helpful. We started with the formaggi and complimentary bread. All very good.

I had read all the reviews on the bucatini bellagio, particularly the saltiness, but the waiter assured me it was not salty. I took my chance and ordered it. I can say it's been awhile since I've inhaled a bowl of pasta, usually I can barely eat half. I ate every single noodle. :D Now when I was eating it, I noticed there was hardly any parma ham and that it was not salty. Well....the ham was all at the bottom and I took a bite and it was salty as the sea! I had no idea parma ham was that salty! However, the sauce and perfectly cooked bucatini was all I needed. The waiter mentioned I could sub for pancetta next time, which I totally will! The seafood pasta was perfect as well. The bolognese was okay, sauce had good flavor. The tagliatelle di funghi had tons of different mushrooms, but the noodles were way overcooked. Overall, for the price, the pasta dishes were on point!

For dessert, I had to order the panna cotta and we ordered the shortcake as well. Both desserts were way too sweet, especially the shortcake. 

The restaurant filled up really quick on the warm Friday evening. I will say to someone else's comments, the chairs to the table ratio is a bit off and took awhile for me to get used to.

We arrived and they were very accommodating to my father in law, who is in a wheelchair and cannot get around too easily. They quickly set a table with enough space for him to maneuver without any problem. We did not even need to ask, they just hopped right to it when we arrived. Once seated our waiter went over the specials and we decided on pastas all around and our waiter recommended a great bottle of wine (we ended up having 2 of that bottle it was a wonderful recommendation) Both of my in-laws ordered dishes that were not really on the menu but the chef and the staff we extremely accommodating to both of them. 

Collectively we had the gnocchi (AMAZING) the mushroom ravioli and 2 pasta dishes that were ordered off the menu. My gnocchi was soft and pillowy in a delicious truffle cream sauce. It was decadent, but hey, it was thanksgiving weekend. The mushroom ravioli was also quite good, I would say the gnocchi was better though.

Pros: 
Service was EXCELLENT! Very attentive, friendly servers. Prompt service and meals came out quickly.
The food was awesome. My stone pot had the perfect blend of heat and sweet thanks to a well done gochujang. Brussel sprouts were just ok for me - nothing special. But the seafood jeong was THE BEST pancake I've ever tasted. Texture was spot on and well balanced flavor with perfect saltiness. 

Cons: 
This place is teeny tiny. The tables could barely fit our food, and we really only ordered one dish each and two appetizers. The space between tables is barely enough for comfort.
Kimchi fried rice wasn't very spicy.

Tip: Seafood jeong and stone pot are a yes from me, dawg.",4,1,2,1,1

Just a store front with really no place to sit, so plan to take your food and devour it elsewhere.",5,0,1,0,1
"i am coming in hot with five stars. Outside seating near a fountain, good service, nice feed overall, and great drinks including a solid Mai Tai and Manhattan that rolls with double Bourbon cherries without having to ask for extra. I was ok after all this.

Potential for a single star beat down on the items below but due to the overall experience, this was not enacted.

1. Ceviche - I thought it was big till I hit a lot of lettuce hiding under the fish and mango. Suggestion would be to perform a chip upgrade with this dish. It arrives with three mini round corn flat tortillas. They are fine but dish would match up really well (IMHO) with deep fried flour tortilla chips.

2. Guac - very nicely done but a tiny bit small. I am not griping big time about this since it was really good but did force me to order another one.

3. Nothing else.

The pork app is epic. Really nice kick to it. Photos will show the rest but I did step up and switch out the standard sauce on the fish entree' and substituted with avocado lime sauce which was very nice. The Horchata ice cream scoop is very authentic and tastes like cold Horchata which was refreshing. I mean, seriously, who doesn't like Horchata anyway?",5,1,1,1,1
I love this place super yummy pizza everything on the menu was just perfect. I love to order online and they deliver it to my house and it's piping hot. Everybody that works there is wonderful. I wish I had a Strawhat pizza. If I had one it would be so cool.,5,0,0,0,1
"Himalayan food is always interesting to me. It is a combination of culture, cuisine and history. When I opened the menu, I see the typical signature items: momos, nan bread and milk tea. What I did not see is a yak-based dish. I am sure it is darn difficult to get any yak in California so I am totally fine with chicken momos instead. It came out tasty and my son loves it. You could tell this place is family run. The lady who took our order, has her son doing homework at a side table. The men in the kitchen were probably family too and they were keen to check in with us to make sure the food is satisfactory. We ordered the garlic naan bread, chicken momos and I was in the mood for lamb vindaloo. All these 3 dishes were great. The vindaloo was pretty spicy and the sauce was spicy and rich. My husband ordered a dish from the specials, which was essentially a grilled steak with sauteed onion and green pepper. To be honest, I am no expert in Himalayan cuisine so i don't know if this is a traditional dish or some newer iteration. The beef was a bit too dry for us and the seasoning was a little on the light end. 

I don't think we will ordered that one again. Nevertheless, the rest of the food was very delicious and there are several tables of patrons dining, who seemed to know the owners well. We will be back!",4,2,2,2,1
"I prefer this location over Hostetter. Parking is easier and you can walk off the food at the shops across! 

It is much easier to get a table here, however service and the time it takes for food to come is almost the same as the Hostetter location. 

The galbi and brisket are my favorite. The bulgogi was weird and looked mushy. Pork belly is a must too but skip the beef belly because it's super tough.

Wish they had lettuce wrap rather than salads and steamed egg. Overall, we had a nice meal here.",4,3,3,4,1
"This is that upscale greek spot you were looking for!
We came here at lunch and there was a lovely ambience.
To start we shared calamari with the homemade pita and dips. The pita was probably the best I've ever had and the dips tasted nice and fresh; although the hummus had a bit of an anchovy taste to me...calamari was a little tasteless but nice and crispy
For mains I had the lamb souvlaki which was delish!! It come medium rare and is tender. It comes with these extra crispy wedges where we're amazing! You only get two on a plate and it would be nice to get another one.

Would recommend!",4,0,0,0,1

"Wow! This place is by far my favorite Korean lunch spot in Concord. My Korean auntie brought me here to meet her Korean church friends. It's located right next door to the Korean Food Market that she likes to shop at for groceries when she wants to stay local.

The owners are very nice and friendly. The food is well seasoned and authentic. I always order the Kalbi (Korean Bar-B-Que Short Ribs). Today, my auntie got the Saeng Sun Jun (Korean Pan Fried Fish). Both lunch specials came with a bowl of rice and a nice selection of Banchan (Korean appetizers/side dishes). Oh! And they also serve Boricha (Korean Barley Tea). My Auntie always tells me that it is better for me than drinking just plain water. I don't know how true that is, but I've become addicted to drinking it now. Everything about lunch today was extremely satisfying! I have always enjoyed my food whenever we've eaten here and spending time with my Auntie is always a pleasure!

The restaurant was full of people eating lunch today, but the waiters kept being friendly and attentive. I love it when service workers continue to work with a smiling face and happy nature even during crowded periods.

Whenever you are in the area and craving great tasting Korean food at a more reasonable price, check this spot out!",4,1,2,1,1
"Husband and I recruited a few people to help us tackle my Yelp bookmarks list. We finally made our way to Nom Burger for a late weekday lunch, and it was AMAZING. This place will make you re-think burgers, LOL.

We ordered:
- loaded tater tots
- nom burger
- gimme some shrooms
- #dateggdoe....with more tots. If you asked me to come up with a dream burger myself, this would be it. Patty, egg, pancetta (in my dreams, it's always bacon), garlic aioli....and no cheese. :)

All our burgers were soooo good. #dateggdoe is the perfect name for our social media generation, and it's the stuff burger dreams are made of. I don't usually eat medium rare, but our waitress recommended it, so I figured I'd try it their way. I've never had a patty so flavorful before. The egg yolk was the perfect amount of runny. Our food came out hot, and most importantly, the tater tots were crispy.

The loaded tots and burgers are very deceiving. They look a lot smaller than they actually are, so come hungry. I ate half my burger for lunch yesterday and ended up skipping dinner completely. The loaded tots are enough for 4-5 people to share, and their side order of tots is big enough for 2-3 people to share. The burgers come out kinda small diameter-wise but are SUPER TALL, requiring the use of a knife/fork (works for me - I prefer it this way bc I'm weird about getting my hands dirty).

The hostess was friendly and welcoming. The waitress we had (I forget her name) has waitressing perfected - she knew exactly when to come to our table without interrupting our conversation. The interior is open-looking and beautiful. Their air system is strong bc we didn't leave smelly (very important to my husband LOL). And their music playlist is FIRE..we kept asking Siri to ""name that tune"" throughout our meal.

A lot of times when we eat out, you can tell that the owners really care about the menu and kinda forgot about the rest of the dining experience. Not the case here. It's clear every detail was very carefully thought out and even more carefully executed by the team. Our group was in full agreement - this was a great dining experience all around!",5,1,3,2,1
"So I visited this spot, whilst searching for something fresh and healthy-ish, which isn't an easy feat in San Ramon- other than Whole Foods. To be fair, I'm not super familiar with the area. However, I was in a hurry and looking for something fresh & decent to grab, this place caught my eye and I gave it a whirl. 

 It offers fresh ingredients, a menu of build your own assembly line type fair... salads, warms plates, sandwiches etc. they seemed to have some decent offerings. The food I had hit the spot. 

 I wondered in late-ish one night on my lunch break looking for something healthy. The staff was super friendly, even thought they were near closing. 

 The food was great. I can't complain a bit. It's not a formal sit down 5-star dining experience with at me service, but if you want to grab something healthy chill and quick, this is for sure a decent spot. It's not the total ""foodie"" spot... this is the healthy side of me spot. 

 I had the trout, basil roasted corn, and Parmesan cauliflower mash for the win, so good! The cauliflower mash is amaze! I would for sure return when I'm in the area jonesing for a quick bit without all the hassle.",4,0,2,1,1

"The corner of Galindo and Salvio has seen some major changes in the last year. Two longtime tenants, Bangkok Kitchen and Contra Costa Trophy & Embroidery, were forced to close due to high rent. Replacing them were four eateries - the already opened Chipotle and Ramen 101; and soon-to-open Burgerim and Fire Wings. 

My family and I tried out Ramen 101 on 04/12/2019. It was very busy when we walked in at 7 pm. The renovated interior looked impressive. It was modern and brightly lit. Seating was made up of about a dozen tables and they were on a first come, first serve basis. A TV was playing pop music from some YouTube channel.

The menu featured a wide array of appetizers, ramen, and rice bowls. Ordering was done at the counter. I ordered 3 bowls of tonkotsu ramen (medium spicy, $10.99 each), grilled whole squid ($7.99), and chicken karaage ($7.99). The total, with a tip, was about $60. I was given a number placard afterwards.

Our order was ready quickly and was brought to us by one of the staff. The grilled squid was nicely done. It came all cut up and garnished with sesame seeds. The texture was soft and supple. The slightly sweet, teriyaki-like sauce gave life to the mild-tasting flesh. Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for the chicken karaage. It was probably one of the worst I have ever had. The nuggets were rock hard, dry, and flavorless. Judging from the look of the exterior, I had a feeling they had been sitting around for a while.

The tonkotsu ramen was generously portioned. It came with a good amount of noodles, two thick slices of chashu, a soft-boiled egg that was halved, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms, fish cake, and bean sprouts. The noodles had a nice chewy texture and the soft-boiled egg was perfectly done. Chashu was flavorful but a bit dry. On the flip side, the broth lacked richness, both in taste and body. Overall, I thought it was OK, but certainly not 5-star worthy.

We received terrific service. The young staff was energetic, friendly, and attentive. They made us feel welcomed and checked on us frequently. Despite a few misses in my experience, Ramen 101 is a nice addition to downtown Concord. You can get a quick bowl of ramen at a reasonable price. OK food + great service = 4 stars

The bar was close by (but the servers brought the drinks to us), appetizers came out fresh/warm, the meals were juicy & they even brought the cake out for us (with a cutting fee of course).

"Happy to find an all vegan restaurant nearby! 

- Pesto fries: one of my fav items there
- Vietnamese ice coffee: tasted just like regular Viet coffee! Would order again 
- Breakfast tots: I recommend if you're a lover of tots. However, it feels a bit heavy to have for a full meal. It'd be better to share as an appetizer 
- Mac and cheese + bbq chicken: the Mac tasted a bit dry but surprisingly tasted great as leftovers the day after

I came back a second time a week after and ordered the:

- cauliflower bites: yum!
- pesto pasta: think this will be my go-to order for this place!

"My husband and I came for happy hour on a Friday night and we were very impressed by the food but underwhelmed with the service. We got a server in training who is been shadowed by someone with more experience and we had to ask for refills on our drinks and we had to ask for an order to be taken. I understand this is not the norm, but I did think it was strange that our food and refills were brought to us by someone from the kitchen and not our server. I asked if I could tip him and he said they share tips which makes me feel better.

We had the fries, taquitos, cheese curds, and the bacon mac & cheese. The fries were on the plane side but they were thick and a very potatoey. The cheese curds were delicious... Can't go wrong with cheese curds. The bacon mac & cheese was very unique and came out in a mini cast-iron skillet. It looked like it had been blackened and made crispy on the skillet and had a charred but not burnt flavor.

My husband went rogue and ordered off the regular menu instead of happy hour and got the Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich. He ate every last bite and really enjoyed it.

We will definitely be back for the food, I just hope we get to server that knows what they're doing.

Cheese Board is uniquely Berkeley - the full experience includes waiting in line, enjoying the lovely music and people watching, all while eating the best vegetarian pizzas in the Bay Area.

"This is a busy Cheesecake Factory location, but the food is worth the wait!

My husband and I came on a Sunday during lunchtime, and as per usual, it was busy. The wait was not too horrible for a Cheesecake Factory, only about 20 to 25 minutes.

Once we were seated, we were served quite quickly. Oh man, the burger that we ordered was so delicious! We got one burger to share and a good thing too because the burgers here are big! It's called the Americana burger, and has 2 cheeses which gave the burger that extra burst of creaminess and saltiness that goes perfectly on a burger. We ordered the burger patty cooked medium, and the cooks did as we requested (last time, they cooked the burger patty well-done). The fries were hot and super fresh. 
After our meal, we ordered the Cinnabon cheesecake! So good! Creamy and sweet and just the right amount of cinnamon so that it's not overwhelming.

"I'm a fan of Japanese curry so definitely wanted to try this place after my parents said it was good.

WAIT: Came on a Saturday at 1:30 pm and the place was packed! We had to wait at least 15 or so minutes just to order and then another 15-20 minutes until our food came. It seemed like the wait came in waves and the food takes a while so people tend to stay for a bit.

ATMOSPHERE: The inside is small with a few tables that can be made into larger tables and then a counter area that faces a wall with single stools for people to sit and eat. Most people try to snag tables before they order and like I said above it takes a while to get your food so you might be waiting for a table. It's simple, bright, airy and clean inside.

FOOD: They have a lot of different options on their menu but I opted for the beef shabu curry and added veggies.

BEEF SHABU SHABU CURRY - their curry is on the thinner/watery side, which is fine but if your preference is for thicker curry then that would be an issue. The beef shabu is interesting because it's so thinly sliced that it looks like ribbons of beef in the curry. When you order the veggies it comes with onions, potatoes, carrots and broccoli so it's a nice addition if you're the type of person that enjoys items in your curry. It comes with a big bowl and half is rice, half is curry. Plenty of food for one person and maybe even enough to share if you're not super hungry.

The curry has a good, homemade flavor and reminded me of curry I had in Japan. Great quality and flavor. The non-spicy/mild has a bit of heat to it (for someone like me who is very sensitive) and my husband got the medium and you could see the spice peppers inside. 

Overall, would definitely recommend if you're a fan of Japanese curry.",4,6,8,6,1

*green curry lunch menu - this came with spring rolls and rice and this soup thing with tofu in it and my it was awesome!!!!!! 

*thai fried rice with pork belly - this wasn't on the menu but I'm a huge fan of pork belly and wanted it with fried rice which I also love very much. This dish was bomb diggity!!

"Dear diary,

I write this, room spinning, as I lay flat in my back wishing it were tomorrow already. I ate Botto's food for the first time today, after hearing so much about it and saw the 'rave reviews'. I needed this in my life. My friend and I got a platter, the carbonara, and two pizzas and just looking at it my arteries began to clog themselves waiting for the binge to begin. It went down alright, nothing like I've ever had before, I'll give it that. No sooner than 30 minutes later, OH NO. What's happening to me. What is this hell I'm living in??! Driving home and I feel it. Barely make it home, and explosions, fire, the world is crumbling. I text my friend I'm going to shower and that nausea is setting in, I tell her if I don't reply in 30 minutes it's because, ""Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!!"" I start the water. Oh God, it's happening again. Contemplating my life choices at this time, should I have listened to all of the one star reviews? Was this a sign from the Italian food Gods?? We'll see if I make it to tomorrow, I don't know if I can stand up straight. Legitimately might have food poisoning, happy MLK Day ya'll. Stay close to a bathroom.

"Sorry to be the resident naysayer on this spot, but I'll keep this brief. If a restaurant offers steamed chicken on its copier-printed menu, then I think I should expect steamed chicken. Ask Little Hong Kong across the street. They made a really good one (review: http://bit.ly/2EvyUJL). Ask Noodles Fresh on the next block. Their Hainan chicken was pretty good (review: http://bit.ly/2wDMx8n). Ask Saigon Seafood Harbor Restaurant near the Pacific East Mall. They made a big platter of it (review: http://bit.ly/2MOShGw). I ordered the $8.88 Steamed Chicken with Chinese Sausage & Black Mushrooms and asked them to leave out the sausage.

What eventually came out was not steamed chicken, not even close. It consisted of pieces of chopped poultry saturated in oil and swimming in soy sauce with exactly five black mushrooms, a smattering of wok-fried vegetables, and enough Chinese sausage to reassemble a small pig (photo: http://bit.ly/2wE49jG). Awful and not the dish I wanted. I tried questioning their steaming method, and with that piece of feedback, I think I may have taken Sino-Japanese relations back to World War II. I could barely touch it, and the complimentary cup of soup was beyond nondescript (photo: http://bit.ly/2MO1zCi).

"Straight outta Pyongyang. 
Feels like a North Korean restaurant operating in an ex-Chinese restaurant in a strip mall of a small town. 
This is not authentic Korean BBQ. 
Limited menu. Possibly the most expensive Ttok boki I've ever ordered. The 2 waitresses were trying but could not keep up with the moderate crowd. 
Food and flavor were ok for a neighborhood restaurant but you can definitely find better 10min away.

"This restaurant finally purchased the real property and I guess inherited the business at the same time from the owners that rented to Sushi Avenue Grill on Marina Blvd. It has been a while and I guess the building finally sold.
I see the current reviews and it continues to have a soft opening.
My wife and I tried their food for the first time tonight.
The food can use some tweaking.
Any dishes that supposedly contain ""Vegetables"" should contain just that! 
They could have put a lot more white onions in the Bulgogi and at the same time add some more green onions.
They could have added more veggies in the vegetable and seafood dish and also let people know that the seafood is basically a fried salt and pepper type and please be sure to add lots of vegetables. And please add some seasoning to the coating in the seafood.
The combination chow mein needed to have some crispy noodles, not like something from a fast food Chinese takeout.
We can say that the service was GREAT and the tentativeness you can't complain.
A word of warning.....NO beer, wine or sake although advertised on their menu due to the fact that apparently ABC hasn't approved their license yet.
What seemed interesting was the bento boxes that were available during lunchtime only(11am-3pm). I actually have not seen the combination of extensive varieties offered before in bento boxes.
May I recommend that i18 also offer this at dinner time?
I have to say that I will give i18 a second chance and also try their lunch bento boxes.

Reshampatti Cauliflower - The taste was good, but this dish tasted like it was reheated in microwave and served.
Garlic Chili Chicken Tikka - I would say this was better among all the other dishes we ordered. But nothing extra ordinary and the salad it came with had a weird smell to it. $10.99 plus tax for this was not justifiable at all.
Patiala Murg Curry - The worst. Just a watery chicken curry and the chicken had no taste to it. $10.99 for this dish was plain robbery.
Chai - Average.
Naan - Okay'ish but too chewy.
Tandoori Roti - Average

"I was excited to have a new place in the 'hood. Unfortunately, they're not living up to the hype. 

Food = mediocre. 

Beef Stew with Turnip = abysmal. It was not edible and had to returned and they removed it from the bill. The beef tendon was revolting because it was way undercooked. It appeared that they had mixed together an older batch of stew with a new batch that was undercooked and decided to serve it as a cohesive dish, which it was not. 

Lemon fruit tea = okay. $4.95.

BBQ Pork Rice roll = bad. The noodles had a tart taste to them, which indicates to me that there must've been improper storage/refrigeration. $5.00.

Sands Pumpkin = Okay. Nothing to write home about. $6.95

Rice = $1.50.

When you fail two out of three dishes, it's not a good outcome for us. 

Service = average. They were inattentive and were busy chitchatting at a nearby table. Given that this was a new place...why were the glasses and chopsticks dirty?!? 

Prices = moderate. Dinner for two came out to $19.96 (this was without the stew, and we ended up picking up take-out from a different place).

"The word ""zut"" literally means ""ah shoot"" in French. It implies that a mistake was made and regret ensued. Unfortunately, this is reflective of our experience at Zut! this weekend. 

First of all, how is this restaurant classified as Mediterranean? 

The host was not friendly but not unfriendly. Just meh. The entrance is crowded and while we stood there waiting for the host, at least 3 people said ""excuse me"" to pass us. We basically felt in the way as soon as we got there. 

We were seated in busy loud corner but I think all the spots are probably busy loud corners...This restaurant doesn't make good use of space. We kept getting our chairs bumped by passers by and wait staff and I could see it was happening to other tables as well. Servers are single file passing each other and weaving between chairs. 

The service was fine. Nothing stood out. Didn't tell us about the specials, and gave no description of the menu. Server gave beverages to wrong people, no attention to detail. Food came out overdone and and under seasoned. 

Pork chop: tough, unevenly cooked and under seasoned 
Ribeye: tough, unevenly cooked and under seasoned....the worst Ribeye I have ever had. It's generally a pretty tender and flavorful cut of meat... what a pity to ruin it. 
Salmon: over cooked and not seasoned at all, just topped with a chunky, dill white cream cheese... not sure what the chunk why sauce was. 
Scallop risotto: scallops were ruined by being overdone and not seasoned. The risotto was very grainy. You could feel each grain of hard/cold rice. Risotto should be velvety and decadent. 

We ordered the olives, Burrata and a half dozen oysters as appies they were unremarkable.

Paid quite a bit of money to take our out of town mothers to this place and had to apologize to them after. 

Our dog on the other hand was very happy because I took the ribeye home and fed it to him. 

What a shame because this restaurant has been around a long time. But really, how does it survive next to gems like Iyasare and Bette's Oceanview diner in a prime location like 4th Street in Berkeley?

He had a look on his face like he did not want to be there and someone had run over his dog at the same time. He never checked up on us for our orders and to refill our beverages.

My main complaint is that my food came out 20 minutes after the rest of my party had gotten their order.

"My main reason for giving this location 2 stars is due to the service we received during our visit. The food was great, and the location has plenty of parking. 

Upon arriving, we put our name on the list. There honestly weren't that many groups on the list (maybe 6 groups of 2-4), except for one large group. However, it took almost half an hour for us to be seated. When I peeked inside the restaurant, I could see empty tables, both cleaned and not cleaned. Wondering why it was taking so long for us to be seated, I decided to wait inside so I could better gauge when we'd be seated. I usually don't do this, but I was starving that day, and starting to get a bit hangry. (Sorry!) 

The person who was standing at the host sign-in area seriously worked at a snail's pace. Instead of seating multiple groups at once to look over menus, he would seat one group every few minutes, despite the open tables. Once they were seated, he walked soooo slowly back to the host station that it was a bit excruciating to watch. I've really never seen anyone walk that slowly to get somewhere. (Of course, he may have had a bad knee or something, but he was a young guy, so it didn't seem likely). 

Finally, it was our turn. We were seated. Hallelujah! It took a while for us to get someone's attention to let them know we were ready to order. We ordered a bag of shrimp and a bag of king crab legs. After ordering, we were never given water, bibs, or ketchup for the fries we ordered; we ended up having to ask for all of the above. Our shrimp came in a timely way. However, our king crab legs arrived 45 minutes later, when we were basically already done eating. Over the course of those 45 min, I asked 3 times whether our king crab legs were on the way, and our server disappeared each time, with nary an update. 

Okay, so we finally got the king crab legs. My husband and I spent half of the 45 min wait wondering if we should just cancel the order. After all, they're pretty expensive and we were getting full from the fries, shrimp, and water. Once our king crab legs arrived, we then found that some of the legs inside the bag were still frozen! If y'all have eaten king crab legs, you know it's hard enough to crack them when they're hot, much less when they're still frozen. So, our server took it back to reheat it. Another 10-15 min. We ate a couple of the legs, but we ended up taking it to go because it took so long to arrive, and it was getting close to 9 pm at that point. We arrived around 7.

"I understand that Orient Express is a place that has been around for about 29 years now so it's obvious that they have their loyal, local customers. With today's competition and particularly in Chinese food, this place is definitely not good and is a matter of fact overrated. 

The place does always look dirty and unkept which says a lot. I question if they even properly store their food, use proper sanitation, etc. They claim they don't use MSG. Regardless, I don't trust the establishment. Don't expect much for customer service, it is what it is. Even if it was great or horrible customer service, their food lacks and the food is what I'm most concerned about. 

I've tried all their sides and entrees and they are either dry, flavorless, oily af, or all of the above. Overall, nothing is tasty! I've eaten at multiple Chinese places and there are many better options out there.

The more I crave for FLAVORFUL food with QUALITY ingredients, the less I decide to spend my money at places like these. But if you like that kind of food: cheap, not nutritious, unhealthy and flavorless, then more power to ya. ;)

"Need to know: Good food, decent beer but bad service. 

It takes a lot for me to complain. I like to give balanced and fair reviews so it pains me to write this.

We went for happy hour at 4 on a Wednesday. There was literally one person at the bar and two people in the seating area. It took us 10 minutes to get a drink and menu. The food came quickly but overall we had to flag down the server three times, every time he was on his phone and at one point a coworker was rubbing his neck. This went on for two minutes and then he showed her something on his phone.... meanwhile our drinks were empty for enough time that we debated just going to the bar and ordering it ourselves. He explained the beers were chose were tapped out and the keg needed to be replaced. Fine, it happens.... but seriously, the wait between drinks, food and being checked on was 20-30 minutes. 

Food: We had the corndogs, garlic fries and cheese curds. All of it was perfect brewery food and overall really tasty. I would come here more often if it wasn't for the service. 

Atmosphere: The place is loud. There is a decent patio out front which is really nice.

Beer: Good! I tried to IPAs and they were both tasty and worth trying again. Overall, I think the beer game is STRONG. But I like beers so I'm pretty easy going when it comes to loving beers. 

Service: The most upsetting thing about the bad service was the place wasn't busy. Our server was on his phone constantly and would step to the side of the bar and lean against the wall to check his phone. This normally isn't a problem... the place was dead when we got there. But having to flag him down, watch him on his phone, and remind him to get drinks was the breaking point. We ended up being there for two hours which really, should have been less time. 

So I will give this place a shot again (out on the deck for sure) and hopefully see if this guy was having an off night.",2,1,3,1,0

Then he seats us but doesn't offer drinks or menus. We are sitting for 30 minutes waiting to get at least a menu and they don't even come up to us. We proceed to ask about the menus but to no avail.

My guy is on his no carb diet and had a craving for The Halal Guys. We entered around 6:15/6:20pm on Wednesday 9/11/19 to one person ahead of us. 
We waited around and placed our order for 2 combo platters served over salad, one small and one regular. 

The guy started off the order looked absolutely MISERABLE and he looked like he could have used a quick dip in a shower|bath. Salad ran out and he grumpily grabbed the back up tray in the fridge and threw it in the assigned area without any regards. Okkkkkaay....
My food proceeded to an petite Asian and although she didn't seem as miserable, it was quite apparent that the customer service aspect was not going to happen. She sauced up our platters and moved it along quickly to be rung up and bagged. 

We chose to sit indoors because the tables outside were absolutely FILTHY. With maybe 4-5 employees on hand, standing around doing nothing, not a single person took the initiative to go out and quickly wipe down the tables. Awesome!! 

Food was okay. Nothing bad but nothing worth raving about. The fluffy pita bread I was looking forward to was stale-like, dry, and just not good.

This lasagna was nowhere lasagna, and as I happen to be a chef and I am part Italian and grew up on lasagnas, it was insulting to call such a mess lasagna. 
It was basically a pile of undercooked stale tomato sauce, some mediocre flavorless cheese and spinach. Not one drop of beef or their so called home made sausages as promised. Nothing. Stale and mediocre.

I've tried a few Burmese eateries including Mandalay and Burma Cafe, and I have to say Rangoon Ruby is just nowhere near as good or authentic. It's more like the Panda Express of Burmese restaurants, and in fact everything is pre-made and in steam tables ready to serve. If you're in a rush, that's a good thing, but Rangoon Ruby serves up a hodge podge of Asian cuisines including Chinese and Thai.

Came here for brunch and ordered huevos rancheroes with the crab and shrimp and I gotta say, I'm not a fan. The flavors were all muted and you could hardly taste crab or shrimp. The neither egg was cooked right, one of them was completely overcooked. I understand that the premium prices are in part due to the location but this was probably the worst I've had.

2nd: The food is tasteless, lacks so much flavor and texture. I ordered Ajillo Chicken and it was nasty! No flavor and big chunks of garlic. I know this plate contains garlic, but big chucks? Really? 
My husband ordered the Seafood Paella, $25 dollars for the plate and it did not even have seafood, how in the world? The plate itself tasted like burned, horrible taste. 

I honestly hate writing bad reviews, but I can't believe we fell for the reviews. We could not finish our food because it was really, really bad, I was super hungry and I'm still am.. 

I like supporting small business, but it gets me sad when they over charged for worthless food. I don't mind paying $25+ for a plate as long as the plate is good, but this time I regret the $50 we paid for this place!!!

There are many more good Peruvian places you should try instead of this one and even for cheaper... but yes if you want, give it a try to this place and you will see I am not lying.",1,0,4,1,0

I ordered Lasagne it was not fresh. It tasted like a warmed up leftover Lasagne from the weekend. It had very little sauce and It was so SALTY

The wait list had 3 parties ahead of us, but we figured out that those parties were no longer there. So why didn't the staff remove them?

Everything we wanted to order from either the kitchen or sushi bar was unavailable. The kitchen was closed and the bar basically ran out of everything. They didn't tell us before we got seated. They told us after we waited 10m to get our drink order.

Not the best, not the worst; very meh. But during my last visit, I just left mid meal. What made things unbearable was the owner obnoxiously drinking with his buddies yelling out all sorts of vulgarities and inappropriate comments.

"Well I love Panda Express and their food, the Hollister California restaurant consistently disappoints. Is the San Jose State University student I am used to having my panda fresh will prepared and served me within a limited time frame. The Panda Express in Hollister is consistently lacking in fresh food and even when I am standing in line and letting the staff know I will be ordering something that is not there it seems that they refused to listen to me.

Today I noticed that there was no orange chicken, which both of my I told the staff members that we would be ordering orange chicken, it seemed that there was nobody available to make it. While I told one employee we would be ordering orange chicken, it seemed to his job was only to prepare sides. The staff were unable to have our food fresh and ready in advance. We had to wait an extra 10 minutes in the restaurant for a takeout order which I tried to tell them in advance. When I asked why there was not an employee to start creating what we wanted to order I was told they were on break. Once the orange chicken was prepared, eight minutes later, two customers behind me were served first. I was already late for my errands, and did not really have the time to have individuals who came after me served first.

It seems that the Panda Express and Hollister needs more Staff. I will not be returning this summer to Panda Express on Hollister because I am tired of having to wait for food, having to wait in line, and not being served in the proper order that food was ordered.
While we were waiting for our order, a woman who ordered online at 11 a.m., who's trying to pick up her order at 2 pm. The staff had not even started to prepare for order. I cannot go back to this Panda again or my blood pressure will go through the roof.",1,2,0,0,0

"Let it be known, I'd rate this place 2.5 stars if I could. I've been here on two different occasions. The servers here were friendly and outgoing. Definitely could sense the new restaurant growing pains, but this was to be expected. Each time I've visited it wasn't crowded. On the first visit, I had Mozzarella Sticks and the Antipasto salad. Both were whatever. 

For the Sticks, the cheese was very gooey inside but tasted and looked like your typical bulk freezer bagged item - something I might see from Applebee's. The Antipasto salad was not very good, in my opinion (as this whole post is ""in my opinion""). The vinegarette dressing tasted quite watery with nothing special about it. As for the salad itself, it tasted like all the toppings were from a can. Since a person usually doesn't frequent places like this just to order a salad, I came back here today for a second go (Football Sunday) and decided to try one of their burgers while my husband and his father had pizza. 

The restaurant itself:
1.) Inside - Pretty decent and is the only brewhouse in the immediate area. The bar is on the smaller side and the same with the patio. There is NOT a tv outside to watch sports if you'd like to sit and enjoy the fresh air and still be a sports fan (I think BJs and Lazy Dog have tvs outside but don't quote me on that). There's lots of light that comes through the large windows, which is pleasant. The bar has three large screen TVs. If you're a football fan and love watching The Red Zone, they do not have this playing. The Yard House does on at least one screen. 

2.) Bathrooms - Very clean with 2 stalls for the woman's bathroom. One large sink that has warm water. Could have put two sinks here though, just in case there's ever a line. 

3.) Beer - Great selection of beer. If you aren't only an IPA drinker, this place has other types of beers as well, which is nice. They do not offer flights at this time or any other size except 16oz pours. Too bad, I can appreciate places that offer flights or half pours so I can drink a larger variety of beer without filling up only on liquid.

As for the food we had today:
When our items came out, the presentation was great! The American Burger (upgrade truffle fries) and especially the pizzas looked really good. The pizzas appeared to have fresh veggies and sausage ( Brew City Special Pizza), so our expectations were high. Too bad, everything was just okay, literally nothing memorable about anything, except it not being memorable at all. My burger bun was probably store-bought - just the average sesame bun. Despite the burger meat coming from Harris Ranch, it was slightly underseasoned and really nothing notable about its flavor. (Side note: If you ever get a chance to visit Harris Ranch going south, great stop to have very good steak for fair prices.) I think In and Out offers better tastes (without animal sauce for direct comparison), and they're considered fast food as well. My truffle fries were not very good. Just because someone grates fresh parm on top of something, doesn't mean the item's now all of a sudden elevated. These were definitely frozen fries before with someone that didn't understand how to use a fryer cooking them. They weren't crispy but more mealy instead. (The Counter and The Village Burger Bar have really good fries, just FYI.) The pizzas were the same. Although having the stellar initial impression, the tastes were just not there. Food wasn't bad by any means, but, honestly, the competition with all these other craft eateries makes this place seem like 2.5 stars for food and 3.5-4 stars for beer. 

Places like The Grub, Yard House, Lazy Dog, Eureka, Rock Bottom, BJs, The Halford, Village Burger, even the Garret, and so on, offer fun and friendly environments with great tasting food and good drinks. At each of these places, there's depth to their food and tastes that set them apart from others. 

I can see Brew City Grill being a good spot since it's local and really the only Grill in the immediate area, but Campbell and Santana Row are close by and offer a better selection of restaurants with better quality food. I'd maybe come back to Brew City for the beer, but not the food. My husband and father-in-law also felt the same about their pizzas.",2,0,0,0,0
"I went there during their soft opening... really disappointed...
I was thinking fusion is a great idea because I can try different food at the same time; however... So they serve Chinese, Japanese(a few rolls and sashimi), Korean (bulgogi, tofu soup), Thai (curry, fried rice).
So I went with my friend, two of us. We order Thai red curry, rainbow roll, Bulgogi and tofu soup combo. Here is my little thought:
Thai red curry: 
This is entree but come with no rice. Interesting. Ok. The basil is so overwhelming that i can taste only basil.
Rainbow Roll:
It has only shrimp, salmon, tuna on top. Rainbow roll is a common roll which has its rules to make. But only 3 kinda of seafood does not make it a rainbow roll. 
Bulgogi:
Biggest disappointment. OMG. Im so regret orderinf it. THIS IS NOT BULGOGI. I love eating Korean food and i swear that is not BULGOGI. It is pan fried beef with heavy sauce on top. It is a Chinese dish. If it is not claimed as bulgogi but a chinese dish, I will say it is good. However! I want bulgogj!! that is not bulgogi!!!
Tofu soup:
They never served me tofu soup. I waited so long. Then I asked the server where is my tofu soup. He said they don't have the ingredients to make so they cancel it. Ok?? then why don't you tell me first? The server can simply tell me they can't make it (I understand, it is soft opening, a lot of things are still not ready. I understand) instead of just letting me wait for an hour.

For service. There were only 3,4 tables (all small groups). I always have to wave to get server attention.
This is a bad first experience. I don't know if i will revisit.",1,0,0,0,0

"Came here for dinner on a weekday. We were seated down, but our table was dirty. There was pieces of food residue and green onions from a previous party. I asked the server to clean it but he ended up giving me the napkins to clean it myself. Um, okay? This already rubbed me off the wrong way, but I did not want to think too much of it. My boyfriend asked to be seated at another table instead.

Menu was an electronic tablet, which I thought was pretty cool. We ordered the $32.99 Cheese ribs pot, $32.99 Shiitake mushroom beef budae jjigae hotpot, $8.99 Fried tofu, iced Citrus tea, and the baked mussels(See pictures attached). The cheese ribs pot was pretty good. The meat slide off the bone and it was delicious with the melted cheese. The steamed egg was slightly sweet. Taro tasted like it had a mash potato texture. The kimchi fish cake was okay. As for the beef hotpot, the broth was flavorful. Meat was fresh. All the other ingredients balanced well with the meat. As for the fried tofu, I really like how fresh it tasted. Soft on the inside while crispy on the outside. 

An hour passed, but I still did not see the baked mussels dish. At the end of dinner, I figured they probably forgot? That's something I don't really understand because there was only 2 parties in the restaurant--a couple and my family. But whatever. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I assumed they didn't charge me the mussel dish. I asked for the bill and plastic containers for the hotpot leftover. The server gave me 2 plastic containers with lids and I found out that they CHARGED the mussel dish on the bill. Seriously? 

I asked the server to correct the bill, which he did. I then asked for a to-go cup for my iced citrus tea drink. Apparently, this restaurant doesn't provide any to-go cups? They gave me a plastic container (that people would put food or soup in) without a lid. 

Servers was inattentive throughout the whole night. They were talking to each other instead of coming to our table when I raised my hand & called for them. Not sure why the service was so crappy when it wasn't busy at all? 

The only thing I liked about this restaurant was the food, not the service. To be honest, if it wasn't for the service, this would've been a 4 Star.",2,2,13,2,0
"I got a sudden craving at 11pm on a Saturday after watching Street Food on Netflix (I know, that was self imposed). The poppin' Korean restaurants in Santa Clara that're open past midnight are my saviors on a more than regular basis than I'd like to admit. With the ratings of this place, I knew I had to try it out. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed for most of the experience. 

Reason for the ""meh"" rating: 
- It was so loud, I couldn't hear myself think 
- The sundubu (soft tofu soup) tasted watered down (I assume from the vegetables). There were also no options for types of sundubu (typically you'd find 2-3 variations at restaurants including seafood, beef, pork, etc.) 
- The ONLY banchan item served was pickled radish. No cucumbers, jap chae, potatoes, or any of the usual goods 
- The servers passed our table 3 times before finally getting to our check 

Reasons for liking this place:
- The korean spicy chicken was delicious 
- The tteok-bokki (spicy rice cakes) was tasty and not too spicy (though I don't have much to compare this to, it was my first time having this dish)

From the mediocre food, the badly lit room that looks like a school gymnasium -just a big square box of a room depressingly dim & LOUD to how FREEZING the place is, I cannot picture us ever going back. Add in the ridiculous lack of parking, the long wait & the lackluster service experience. The menu had promise but the food is super blah. One of us had food poising immediately puking up the impossible burger outside. Those are expensive and likely rarely ordered in this kind of loud, sports bar type place.

"I have been on a health kick since my hospitalization and God knows how long that would last! I know...I know, this has to be a lifestyle change rather than a short-term stint! I would not have ordinarily patronized three vegan restaurants in a row. I thought this time it would be interesting to check out for the first time a Vietnamese vegetarian/vegan restaurant!

I started with the tried and true Wonton Soup. ($6.75) It was no surprise that this was an adaptation from the Chinese. While Veggie Today's version might not be 100% vegan as reported by some yelpers, it did give some hearty slurps. The broth was strong and aromatic with crunchy baby bok choy, broccoli, slivers of fried onions and fresh herbs slow boiled into a full-bodied broth. The wonton skin however was of inferior quality being coarse, thick and doughy rather than smooth, thin and silky. (3/5)

My wife is a spice fiend and she can never resist a piping hot bowl of Vermicelli Curry ($6.75) with all its fixings. For my sake, she ordered it mild and it had just the right level of heat although the broth still looked threateningly reddish. We both agreed it was disappointing on two counts. Firstly, the curry broth was overwhelmed by an overload of lemongrass. I don't deny lemongrass does impart a nice flavor and fragrance if used judiciously. But in this case, it overpowered everything else in the curry! Secondly, the broth was over the top sweet. I had to squeeze lemon juice to dilute the sweetness and bring it down to a more palatable level. (2/5)

The Mushroom Tofu Claypot ($9.50) was self-explanatory. Shitake mushrooms and pan-fried cubes of tofu were braised in a thick sweet sauce. The sauce was tasty no doubt, but like the curry, it was overly sweet. This was unfortunate as the sauce need not be this sweet! Plus, you need not be an ardent fan of tofu to enjoy this! We salvaged the tofu and mushroom pieces leaving the sauce. We could have used a little of the sauce by drizzling it over brown rice and eating it that way! (2.5/5)

We saved the best for last! Salted and Pepper Shrimp ($13.50) was served over a bed of traditional Vietnamese style salad in a sweet and savory dressing. There were the unmistakable tastes of cilantros and jalapenos! Without exception, all other yelpers raved about this dish! I wouldn't say the faux shrimps had the exact same texture and taste of real shrimps but were darn close. The savoriness and sweetness blended well together with a super crispy batter to boot. (4/5)

As expected in most Asian restaurants, service was non-existent. The young server was like a deer in headlights and clueless of the food she served. The d�����cor was definitely no frills where you are expected to eat and leave and not so much to linger. It was a definite plus that MSG was not used to adulterate the natural flavors. On the minus side, I believe sugar was used as a substitute and that might explain the over the top sweetness in their dishes. Diabetics beware, as this is a question of win some and ",2,18,28,21,0

"I'm not sure why this place has such high ratings. This is for a one-star review - I'm only making it two stars because the food was acceptable. 

My friends and I chose this place for a reunion dinner for a friend who had just moved to Concord. We were there pretty early for a group of 6 and made sure to put our names down. We waited for 30 minutes to be seated because, like most restaurants nowadays, they don't seat you until your entire party is here. Which is fine. We got seated save for one person who was going to be late. 

I ordered a lion king baked roll. From experiences at other restaurants, this takes at most 15-30 minutes to come out, no more than that. We placed our order at 7 PM. I saw another table - that couple got seated a couple minutes after us, but got their food within 30 minutes. My entire party's food didn't come until a WHOLE HOUR after we placed our order. I had flagged down the waitress after 30 minutes to politely ask if the food was on its way. I'm not sure if that pissed her off, because my order came last. Everyone else in my group - including the one who was late - their food had arrived and were halfway done and my roll finally came at 8:30 PM. 

This service is just appalling. I understand it's dinner time and there's a lot of tables to tend to, but this is about the worst service I've ever experienced.

It was delicious & the chicken kebabs were absolutely perfect. Baklava is delicious too. 
The girl at the register was the same girl the first we were there & she was very friendly & nice.
We will be back for sure! 

08/22/19 Today's visit was definitely 1 Star for customer service what started off as positive soon escalated to a 1 star visit . I had e-mailed a reply informing them that my baklava was missing. An immediate response & very friendly.

"This was one of the worst dinning experiences I've experienced in a long time. My friends and I had dinner reservations at 6:30pm and when we showed up it felt like an inferno, it literally felt like it was a 100 degrees in the restaurant. I sat down to look at the menu and the owner demands that I give her my menu to give it to another table that arrived after ours, we had ten people in party but only had 4 menus to order from? It took them an half hour to get us 2 waters and 4 beers. By the time we ordered our food we had been sitting for at least 40 minutes. The owner wouldn't let my fianc����� order one plate of Jaeger Schnitzel to share even though the Schnitzel portions that were served were enough to feed two grown men. Our friends food order was never accounted for and they had to wait an hour and a half before getting any food after the rest is already finished our meals.

"Just a quick update regarding our latest visit. We tried getting a table around 11:15am. The greeter informed us that they were going to take a few minutes to set up a table for 5 adults, 2 children and a baby. Three minutes later, the other greeter let us know the wait was going to be between 30 minutes to an hour. Mind you, the restaurant was pretty empty. It was really contradictory messages from one greeter to the other. An hour is quite the wait for, again, being dead. 

My friends felt as though the delay was due to the children in our party. Not sure if that's the case, but it was pretty odd how it all went down. Either way, I'll probably think twice about coming here again.",2,0,0,0,0
"I grew up with Peruvian neighbors, which means I grew up loving Peruvian food. I've tried other places around the Bay Area and this is by far the worst. The chicha wasn't good at all. It didn't taste authentic. 
Our appetizer dish was papa a la huancaina. It was good. (Again not the best I've tried). 
For our main dish, I ordered tallar������n verde con pollo and the chicken was EXTREMELY salty. I love my food salty (it's my weakness) but this way far too much. My mom ordered their daily special. I cannot remember the name, but it was lamb with rice, beans and yuca. Everything but the rice was salty. 
When we approached the waitress in a friendly manner to inform her about the quality of the food she""oh that's weird because we've been serving it all day and no one said it was salty. Maybe you guys aren't used to eating salt."" 
I understand the pressure of working as a waitress but that was not a polite answer for a customer. We weren't asking for a free meal, we only gave her our feedback.

The meat quality was ok. I don't like ordering marinated meats at AYCE other than Galbi bc I feel like it hides the freshness. The hotpot was alright. 

The dim sum portion was not good. The xiao long bao was really bad. The green onion pancake was doughy.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but this miso veggie soup tastes like eggs although eggs were not part of the ingredients. Something was completely off about the taste of the soup. The flavors did not mesh together and it was very bland. Not much veggies you get either. There were like 4 pieces of tofu so ask for extra if you want more and mushrooms as well.

"I had bookmarked this place a while back, looking for an opportunity to eat there. Sad to say that food quality felt uneven on our visit.

Good:
- Evening started out well. We had a larger group and ordered the fully loaded tater tots to share. They were tasty, but also pretty hard to screw up.
- The burger buns were great! Apparently they are baked from scratch every day. In fact, the restaurant closed early that day because they ran out of buns.
- Some of our party had the Shroom burger and reported it was good.

Not so good:
- I had the DatEggDoe burger. Buns tasted good, as mentioned. Beef patty was ok, but not memorable, and made a little thick for my liking. It was hard to eat the burgers due to their height.
- A bit too burnt for me. I get that they try to burn the toppings (bacon) for flavor, but it was overdone for my taste.

Family and I came in with a 7:30 reservation and the moment we had to wait 15 minutes just for a hostess to walk up and acknowledge us I should have known we were in for a bad night.

Service - we were barely seated (at a table that was still dirty), didn't have enough place settings for our group and a waiter didn't come to say hello or take our order for a full 30 minutes. We got up and got our own menus and had to hunt down water to drink.

Food - Absolutely awful. After waiting a full 45 minutes the food was disgusting. I ordered the Ravioli Portobello and no lie there were exactly 4 Ravioli on the plate AND It was cold. About the same with the others in my party, cold food that was horribly seasoned or bland. 

We NEVER had anyone come and check on us and we had to get up to ask for our check so we can leave. It then took another 15-20 minutes for someone to bring the check after we requested it.

"This is not a fine dining or elegant French-Vietnamese place as they advertise. They are nothing better than a hole in the wall Asian restaurant that you find in every strip mall. Just larger but with fine dining prices. When we arrived they asked us for 5 min to be seated. We noticed that only one of the tables had food, rest all tables (about 60 people) were waiting. We were just about to leave when they seated us. Water was served and order was taken. Then came some ordinary store bought bread and butter. And then we waited... and waited.... and waited... and waited some more!

It took 45 min for 4 pieces of ordinary oil soaked wonton wrapped crab puffs to come. Had below avg sweet chili sauce which you get with cheap egg rolls everywhere. Crab inside puffs was stale and tasteless. 10 min later came the papaya salad w shrimp - small size 2 shrimp again tasteless fried in thick batter. And salad was tiny and very ordinary also. Then we waited again. 1 hr and 15 min later when there was no sign of food, we just got up and went to counter and said we wanted to cancel the entrees and leave. The waiter got into an argument with my husband saying chicken takes long time to prepare. Really? More than an hour? And this is customer service? You argue with an unsatisfied client on the counter. We paid for the appetizers and left. Prices are high - $30+ for fish entree, $42 for steak, smallest appetizer is $10.

Out because the food pics on yelp and google looked amazing.

After our order was place we never saw our waitress again, and the food wasn't brought out together. A couple of mins between plates is acceptable but it was about 10-15 mins which makes things awkward because you don't want to eat cold food but you don't wanna eat in front of someone who's starving.

Paneer jalfrezi was again carrot and paneer! We wondered why was the paneer so hard.

My husband had the salmon as well, except he got the sweet potato fries instead of the rice. I had a few sweet potato fries and they were the most flavorful of all we ordered.

Also - the mega huge Mozzarella cheese sticks tasted gross. Remember bigger is not always better, especially in this case! The breading around it tasted horrible and burnt. The oil they cooked it in tasted OLD. Two stars because their lettuce was actually fresh.

"Bad dining experience due to dishonesty and poor hygenie! A very harsh critic to an otherwise good food and courteous servers. 

I dislike a dishonest business period. When the pasta dish first ingredients were jumbo scallops and the dish turned up with only clams (!) it spells dishonest to me rather than a simple mistake. I had to pointed it out in the menu, the waiter made me dig for the scallops that he said should be in the middle of the mount of pasta (which there is none) and ended up having to wait for my dish, which essentially ruined our dining experience as we ended up eating out of sync on our couple night out. 

Poor hygiene comes from the coctail drink that came in fingerprinted dirty glass and glassy oily drink... yuck! It was so disgusting and again I had to wait for the waiter to come back and showed him the problem. He brought back another glass that is acceptable to drink as I didn't want to ruin my evening entirely.

My husband was persuaded to have a ragu meat (which is basically old meat cooked for hours) that is not on the menu instead of the ribeye he wanted for the same price. Again, he ate it with a smile and we really didn't want to ruin our evening BUT this establishment embraces the same tactic as supermarkets who sell 'almost out of date' seafood as 'special of the day' as the waiter who appears very gentleman-like offers my husband 'old meat' as special of the day in substitute for grilled ribeye that has to be made from fresh. 

In addition, the outside dining is quite crude... wobbly table that I had to fix with next table's napkin and the chairs are small, cold, metal stools with no back rest.

At the end, the waiter offered us tiramisu for free. We still gave a good 18% tip for the waiter who was nice to us and tried to correct the 'problems'. 

Bottom line, my dining experience was ruined by problems that arised from what I consider systematic 'shady' operation than honest mistakes.

We have 7 people seated, she brings 2 cups of ice water when we specifically ask for 7. She then she brings 3 more (10 minutes longer and still short 2 cups) and had to stop another waitress to ask for 2 more.

"Location: it's in a bar and located at the back, near the restroom. There r three different areas to sit and plenty of TVs. 

Service: the person taking food orders was friendly, maybe a bit too friendly, coming off as more interested in chatting. Funny guy though: his words for describing the hot bbq sauce: it's less of a shower and more of grower. Once you've placed your order, you're given a buzzer and we were told our order would come out in 15-20min. We waited almost an hour and a half before the buzzer rang, and we picked up our food at the counter. How does 20min turn into almost 90min?

Food: we shared a longhorn special, which comes with three meats and two sides in addition to two cornbread. We got smoked tofu, brisket, and ribs. Portions were more meager than we anticipated - you order a meal named the ""longhorn "" special, you would think that means Texas-sized portions, right?! Nope. 

The ribs were decent but nothing special, not worth waiting more than an hour. The brisket was better, moist and a little on the fatty side. The tofu, as another reviewer mentioned, was too thinly sliced and oversaturated in the bbq sauce. We also got potato salad, tots, and cornbread. The potato salad was not bad but was served in a slightly larger ketchup-sized plastic container. Tots you can't go wrong - they were freshly fried and sprinkled in Parmesan powder. The cornbread desperately needed moisture, so dry, they were hard to consume. 

Value: with tip, we spent almost $50, excluding drinks. We could have gone a block down and got a nice bone-in ribeye for that price.

"This review is only for the lunch special Big Bowl for $13.99. My hubs and I decided to try this out seeing that the reviews were so stellar. We are pretty much English-speaking only, and I can speak a little broken Chinese, and let me tell you it was soooo difficult communicating with the waitor/waitress. I don't read chinese, and I was trying to ask what yam noodles were, I showed him a picture online and asked if that's the same. He just said he doesn't know what it is and he wasn't able to describe to me either, just said it was wide. I can tell he was annoyed at me. 

I asked for the spicy soup, with just mild amount of spiciness. He said it's not possible, and that I'm better off ordering something not spicy and adding my own sauce. Every other hot pot place I've been to allowed for adjustment of spice level, except for this place. 

Then the Big Bowl came, which is just a bowl of items that you chose, you don't get to cook it. The most disappointing thing was that it wasn't hot, like hot pot stuff is supposed to be! After a few bites, I couldn't handle it anymore, so I asked the lady waitress (since the man waitress was annoyed at me), if she could microwave it for me. She said, it's not possible, and that they usually pour hot soup over the ingredients inside the kitchen. Ummmm, now I question the food safety, you mean everything wasn't boiled together? Why couldn't she just bring out a little pot for me and use the stove in front of me to heat it up? It is afterall a hot pot place? Or bring it back in and heat it up for me in a pot, that they can wash after. She just said no, and left it at that. I left the rest of my meal, and I brought it home to make sure it's boiled and safe! 

The quality of the food was just so so and the portions is quite small for the price you pay. Again, this is just for the Big Bowl lunch special. They really shouldn't call it a ""Big Bowl"" though, it's anything but big.

"The food is average at best. I can only assume there are not alot of good taco places in Albany that this gets rave reviews. First time I ate here a few years ago while at the Hotsy Totsy. None of us even ate half our food it was that ""meh"". Went back recently. Got a carne asada burrito. $8. Burrito was meat, beans, rice. Salsa and cheese in the first two bites, then no more. Meat was dry. The lady taking order was quite salty. Her attitude and mean mugging got old real quick. 
I recommend the Taco Bell a block away instead.",2,0,0,0,0
"Not really worth eating here unless you are desperate because nothing else within walking-distance on a hot day from the movie theater is open and you are just starving. I ended up here because all the other Asian restaurants within a short walk were closed after lunch.

Walked in on a hot day and asked to be sat somewhere cool. There is no air conditioning. In fact, the vents are covered. The waitress sat me down to an open window. Air was stale because there's not enough circulation from the one window they had open on a 93-degree day.

The place smells like old grease and dirty mop water. The tables and seats are sticky and dirty. The silverware needs to be replaced.

The waitress got me a glass of ice water in an old cup that really needs to be thrown out. She took my order and went off immediately to put it in. I ordered some soft tofu soup and an appetizer. I ran out of water well before my order ever came. The waitress didn't bother checking in on me as she was too busy talking to another waitress upfront. I didn't get a water refill until I was done eating. Mind you, I was the only one there the whole time.

The meal came with the small starter dishes, which is awesome but doesn't taste as good as other places. The tofu soup was tiny and not very good. The only thing I really liked was the pan-fried tofu. Kinda hard to mess that one up. 

This place is expensive and definitely not worth it unless, as I said, you are incredibly desperate. Even then, don't expect to be wowed by the food or the service.",1,1,3,0,0

Just meat, potatoes, and as if the fatty greasy cut of meat wasnt enough, they drowned the dish in oil.... im not talking about a just little reduced fat from the short rib, the mashed potatoes that the rib meat was served on were literally submerged in oil.

"This is a review on the DISHONEST BUSINESS practice at Rosy's. Let me explain. 

When we go to a restaurant and instructed to walk up to the register to pay for our food, we put our trust on the cashier. We pay the amount the cashier tells us. Right? Don't! Not at Rosy's Cafe. Do not trust the heavy set lady when she rings you up. First of all, she does not give you a breakdown nor does she give you your receipt. Second, she does not bother to use the cash register to print your receipt (probably they do not report their sales to the IRS). Just like the 2 trusting people paying ahead of us, she just blurted out our tab $30.24. This is the point where you WATCH OUT. She just jacked up your tab. VERY DISHONEST! Although we paid the questionable amount, we approached the manager to ASK FOR AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT. Did I say ITEMIZED? She seemed offended and arrogantly says, ""...look it up yourself. It's there in the menu."" Huh?? Why the attitude? Defensive because they pad your bill. So, we looked it up in the menu:
--Joe's Special Omelet = $10
-- add Avocado = $ 2 
--Pork Chops and Eggs = $11
--1 Coffee = $ 2.50
 Subtotal $25.50
 9.75% Sales Tax $ 2.49

--TOTAL: $27.99 

So, where did the $30.24 come from? 
It is but a few dollars difference; but, why cheat? Why take advantage of a customer? 

Folks, we wanted to support the local Hayward business. But NOT DISHONEST business.",1,1,4,0,0
"When in So Cal, we make it a point to eat at CA Fish Grill in various locations in Orange County, so when we saw this location open up, were pretty excited. We learned that the cooks at each location can make or break the meal. 

Finally stopped in and picked up an order on the way home from work. The service was as expected, but with not many customers, the wait seemed long. 

Could not wait to get home and start eating... I ordered the grilled Tilapia with garlic butter, rice and corn. Unfortunately for me, close to the end of my meal, I found out that the fish was under cooked, with a large part of it very cold and hard, almost like a tough jelly consistency. I could not even cut it with the plastic knife they provided. It had me thinking whether I had actually eaten an entirely undercooked fish...

I shouldn't have been surprised when my food didn't come after 10 min and another guy came to ask ""are you ready?"" I should have left right then.. So about the food: the soup was bland, and as you can see from the pic I provided, there were no condiments to make it better. My noodle didn't come with ANY fried pork (which really makes the noodle awesome IMO). And to top things off, they never offered or brought me water.

"This place is not a good place for great BBQ and let me restate the word great. I got the pork ribs and belly. The number one thing they're lacking is the smoke flavor. Two, the rub is too heavy like you smell this aroma that isn't pleasant. You want a good amount of rub but you need a good flavor and this place doesn't have that. They also lack the sweetness. Also, the ribs is not too tender. The belly is dry at parts.

The flavor is mainly the reason I'm giving this such low ratings. When I eat bbq pork, I need sweet and smoky.

"I really want to give a higher rating because it's clear the owner is trying really hard, and she's very sweet. This is a belated review from a couple months ago, so they may have worked out some of the kinks since then.

We originally came to check out WeBoba after I saw mochi waffles on the menu, but when we got there we were told that the waffles were only offered on weekends. Watch out for that since it isn't mentioned on their menus. So we went for the Rose Black Milk Tea instead (it was listed as a popular item), plus a popcorn chicken. The rose flavor in the drink was quite concentrated in my opinion, and way overpowered the milk and tea flavors. The popcorn chicken took a while to come out, and it wasn't as spicy as we expected, even after adding more spice ourselves.

However, the owner was there that day and came to talk to us and collect our feedback. She was aware of the popcorn chicken spice issue and was working on getting something more authentic. She also took note on my opinion about the tea, and I'm sure they have been adjusting their various recipes since then.

"This place is Meh at best. The whole idea of the interior and exterior of this place is quite amazing. However, the food did not stand up to my expectations. Let me go ahead and break this review down in a few sections. 

Design- Really cool. It looks like a ship inside and out. The interior has glass walls that overlook the San Fran Bay. Totally breathtaking. 

The Service- Really not horrible. They accommodated our party of 8 without reservation in the middle of a tradeshow nearby. Granted, we did have to sit at separate tables, it wasn't so bad. 

The Menu- HUGE! There are so many options it makes my head spin. Although, the appetizer portion did not seem like it had much to choose from. But, I am on a diet restriction so that's just my opinion. Fresher apps' would have been nice. 

The Food- 
We ordered two appetizers, the Calamari and the Crab Fondue with Spinach. The calamari was a large portion and it was more than enough to share with the table. The breading was light and it was really quite good. The fondue was the star of the appetizer show. It was plated nicely and was served piping hot. It was really good. 

I ordered the double shrimp & crab sizzling iron skillet. The crab was good per usual. I am not a fan of the secret garlic sauce they pour over everything. It was really salty and overpowered the freshness of the crab. The shrimp was HORRIBLE. It was way overcooked and almost impossible to peel. 

We did, however get dessert for our boss's birthday. That was nice.

Underwhelming. Like, VERY underwhelming. Overrated. HELLA overrated. Expensive. Bland. Not for Shayla.
 
It has taken me years to finally try this famous ""Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen"". Now that I've tried it, I've come to the conclusion that this is not Louisiana style cooking. It ain't nowhere NEAR it if I'm being honest. Had dinner here on a busy Friday night and was left disappointed. Since I dined solo that night, the wait wasn't too crazy. This place is always packed and I'm not sure if they take reservations, but you can usually find open seating at the bar if you're coming alone or if you don't wanna wait long for a table. 
 
When I was finally seated, service started and ended very slow. I guess it's to be expected with a busy place like this. It was also minimal. I didn't see much of my server at all. Just to note, this bar is beer and wine only so there aren't really any bartenders up there. Decided to order the crawfish etouffee and the hush puppies since many people have raved about this dish. Y'all... what the EF was THAT?? Def NOT etouffee!!! 

Yes, there was crawfish... crawfish that looked like it had been boiled in gravy. Actually, it was more like crawfish covered in gravy. That's exactly how it tasted too. But, a bland ass gravy. Not much flavor going on there. A major disappointment. The sweet tea that I ordered tasted watered down as well. The only real standout here were those hush puppies, and thank GAWD that at least those were good because I probably would have still be starving.

The hush puppies were legit. They were nice and crispy and packed full of flavor. They arrived piping hot as if they had just been taken out of the fryer. That butter was melting' all over those babies! Mmm, so good! But, I didn't come all of the way over here for just some damn hush puppies! I was still disappointed in my entree. For the prices that they're charging and from all of the rave reviews, I just expected so much more. Maybe in the future I'll come back to try something else, but it definitely won't be anytime soon.

Two things caught my attention, one was the container was smaller, the other the rings were smaller? Most of the onion rings were about the size of a 50 cent piece. I mean who in food service is hurting so bad for profits that you have to skimp on onion rings? Now although the chicken club sandwich looked great! The flavor was very bland, and the breast was on the small side. I mean really, where are they buying these mini chickens at? You're last 3 bites are just bread? The green leaf lettuce was droopy almost oily. The avocado was ok, but the bread was missing something that I can't put my finger on?? So I will have to pass on this location.",2,2,4,1,0
HA!! $12 for maguro nigiri (2pc) and $8 for salmon nigiri? Even Nobu or Ozumo in Santana Row doesn't charge that much for their nigiri. Look at the pictures of how thin the slices of fish are! $12???????,1,2,7,1,0
"So where do I begin? Ambiance, food and the vibe here were pretty good. Me and my friend were really looking forward to a good time. However it was the terrible service that I'm giving this place 0 stars. 

After getting situated with the hostess, they told us if we check in on yelp we get a free drink so we checked in on yelp. I received my free champagne glass, it was nice. We ordered: French fries, ""stix"" (2 sticks of chicken chunks, 2 of beef, and 2 of shrimp all in each separate sauces with 3 side dipping sauces) and corn elote (with cheese and cream) for starters. Corn elote was small but delicious. I ordered only coke to drink and my friend was attempting to order the mojito flight. 

However this is how for some unknown reason we started to be completely forgotten while food and drink delays kept happening. My friend received her free yelp champagne much later, kept trying to tell the waiter about it and he brought it over and quickly left without her being able to order the mojito flight. He eventually brought my coke without a straw which I then requested. Took 5 mins to get that straw while I'm seeing him constantly serve other people. Like it's one straw dude, how long does it take you to deliver a straw?

Mind you when we came in, it was quite busy but at this point two of their largest groups were gone and mainly there were people sitting at the bar. So it didn't seem they were busy to take this long to bring food and drinks for JUST two people. Also other people ordered tons of drinks and food unlike us. 

Eventually we got the fries. I told my friend let's wait a bit for the stix as I wanted to eat the meat along with the fries. However it took total of ~45 mins for us to receive the stix! In mean time we asked the waiter hey how come it's taking so long? And he said that they make it fresh and bring it out fresh. 

Eventually my friend insisted to talk to the manager. I felt embarrassed to do that but I was also quite irritated at this point that our service is taking so long while everyone else is getting tons of their drinks and food no problem. Me and my friend have both worked in customer service jobs so we know how it is and we are respectful ladies. Not some random douches who want to make people's lives miserable for no reason. 

The manager showed up, 20 something year old girl who was nice and surprised that we waited this long for our food and drinks and also couldn't explain why. She said she'll go talk to the waiter and see what happened. Then she just disappeared and never came back. I've never seen this happen before, quite unprofessional. She did take off $30 (half of our check) when we saw the receipt. That was nice but the point wasn't about the money. We can afford to pay the bill no problem and wanted to try out more food and dessert but apparently that's not what the management and anybody who works there cared for. They had this attitude oh who cares about these customers particularly!

By the way the super greatly reviewed Jacob was our waiter lol. He didn't give us attitude but simply wasn't around, never apologized or try to make up for the lack of crappy lacking service. We didn't get any explanation as to why the food and drinks were so delayed 
besides the lame excuse that ""stix"" (which a 2 year old could fry up faster) are fresh and served fresh. Why thank you. I guess we should expect moldy food if we don't wanna wait 45 mins for 6 sticks of meat. Why didn't you even bother to tell us it will take this long to begin with? We would've chosen another place or cancelled the order. 

We pretty much finished the fries by the time the infamous stix arrived. Jacob just awkwardly brought the stix over. Afterwards he was so ""wonderful"" to never clean up our table and just bring the check. The manager reappeared afar at the bar and never approached us again. I pretty much didn't even acknowledge Jacob when he brought the stix over. 

I tried using the bathroom only to uncover the toilet wasn't flushed, loaded with urine and some on the floor. I tried the other bathroom and apparently someone was in there and forgot to lock the door so slammed it back at me. Maybe it was Jacob playing video games while we were waiting to get our food and drinks lol.

I rarely care to post yelp reviews but was urged to write this one by my friends who heard about my bad experience. Really disappointed.I know I'm not demanding, I'm not rude and quite patient when going to restaurants etc. But this was beyond anyone's patience so there's the review. 

Do I think you'll have a similar experience? Probably not. Seems like Jacob was somehow in brilliant spirits for lots of other customers who posted all of these 5 star reviews about him. But last night he just did not give a damn about me and my friend. Food and drinks are decent, a bit overpriced if you ask me. Ambiance is cool. I really wanted to like this place trust me. I hope you have a better experience than I did.",1,2,3,1,0
"I don't typically leave bad reviews due to service because I feel like reviews should be based on food. However their service is so terrible that I will never recommend this place to anyone or go back. 

We were forced to sit in a crammed space even though the restaurant was empty. They said it will get busy since it's the weekend but the place was still 2/3 empty by the time we left. 

Then we were forced to order 4 dishes because they won't take credit card for anything less than 2. We had actually ordered 3 things but he said since 2 of them adds up to be a meal option, it doesn't count. 

Everything tasted terrible except for the shengjian which I would give 4/5 for. 

We left no tip since the service was so poor. he chased us out screaming at us that we should get take out next time if we do not leave a tip.",1,1,5,1,0
"Well, I must say the food we order was good. We had the crab and shrimp with the butter garlic flavor. It was not as tasty as other places but it was good. The sweet potatoes fries were nice and hot but I thought it was weird they serve them with butter and not ketchup. We ordered rice and we were told they had run out, we asked another waiter and they went and brought us the rice.... a bit odd. 

The reason I gave this place 2 stars was that, this is a family restaurant so I thought anyways, but how can you take kids here when they have music that every other word was the ""F"" word and the ""B"" word, literally everyone in my party stared at each other like what in the world, did we just hear that right, there playing music with all that foul language. Everyone serving is young and I get that they may like that kind of music, but what about the customers, how can you bring your kids into this place when that's the music being played. If the owners read these reviews please be aware that you will loose customers if you chose to play that type of music, seriously it's not a night club, hopefully they will change there ways, because the food is actually decent.

And one more thing, they should clean the front of the restaurant because it's quite dirty and clean around the sinks, it's a big turn off it go wash your hands and see it so dirty.",2,2,2,0,0

"Terrible. I wrote a review that Yelp removed bc the owner complained. The original review cited food sanitation issues, dogs being touched and pet and then food being served with those unwashed hands and other customers being ignored.

"La pi�����ata used to be one my favorite restaurants; however, I was quickly reminded that not all locations are created equal ( Alameda and San Leandro are my go to). 

For so so Mexican food, the prices were mind blowing. A $5 up charge for my friend to substitute shrimp. Then an additional $1.92 for chips because we ordered to go (other locations include chips). 

While the restaurant was clean and the food came out quickly, the flavors were underwhelming to the point of my Chile Relleno tasting like nothing more than a mass of cheese and veggies (I've had better at Chevys). The shrimp were also quite disappointing (rubbery and not all were cleaned)

Sometime we would be waiting a long while before the next dish came out. We were one of the first customers and we ask for repeat of one dish and the waitress said they were already out. Rice balls came out the very last, quite a while after our last dish. It seem like they started making it after we asked about it. We would have ordered desert but we were afraid of how long we would have to wait. We ending up going to a wonderful gelato place. It was very disappointing since I don't get to SF that often and the restaurant was so ill equip to give customers the service that they deserve.",2,0,0,0,0
"I've been wanting to try this place since I've seen the great reviews and I've never had this style of food before. I had pretty high expectations because the food looked really good and everyone seemed so amazed! 

I ordered what seemed to be the most popular on Yelp. The rotisserie chicken, da porchetta, passion ceviche, roasted potatoes, casserole mushrooms, and sweet chili glazed carrots. It was really hard to choose since there was so many choices, everything was al carte, the cashier wasn't helpful when I asked for recommendations, I couldn't see the prices on the menu and it was just overwhelming. I was blindly ordering since the menu on top of the cashier seemed to be the only one available and not another one was given to us to hold. I don't know why I didn't ask for the prices, I think I just expected it to be around the same price as Boston Market. I ended up spending over $60 on food we did not enjoy nor finish. I would not have ordered that much if I knew the prices either! Seems a bit like a tactic and it worked on me.. 

The food came out beautifully. The presentation looks simple and elegant. I've never had ceviche before and I really loved it! Honestly the reason for the 2 stars. The chicken was a disappointment. The skin had good flavor, but the meat was very bland and dry. I barely touched it after eating the skin and I love chicken! The Da Porchetta is good. I just saw now that it costs $14. If I saw that price next to it, I would not have ordered it. It was good, but not that good to cost $14! The only good side was the sauce of the mushroom casserole and the roasted potatoes. 

My husband enjoyed the chimichurri sauce, but I didn't like any of the choices. 

MY PROS
-Cute water station
-Good food presentation
-Good flavors, I see potential improvement

MY CONS
-Overpriced
-Food needs improvement
-Prices are not on the big menu above the cashier 
-No combos, everything is al carte

"Do not plan an event at Blue Door!

On multiple occasions, the owner cancelled in-person appointments to schedule the event. Once we finally got it on the books, the owner cared more about nickel-and-diming us than about the service we received. The food they served was mediocre and the prices were way too high. Also, there were constant conflicting messages between the owner and the managers! 

I've been there before for food, and thought it was ok, but this took it to a whole new/different level.

And to answer the owner's reply, I don't know what a ""paid Yelper"" is. I had time this evening to catch up with a few reviews, so I did. It's pretty hilarious to attack the person making a legit review of events held at your establishment.",1,1,6,0,0
I went for a run and on the way back to the hotel decided to grab something here for dinner. I got the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with rice. It was probably the worst chicken bowl I have ever had.

"It's my second time being there and I'm disappointed. The #7 braised pork noodle was pretty good, but the sour and spicy noodles didn't meet our expectations. It was plain oily and salty and even I, who couldn't eat spicy food, didn't taste any spice in that bowl of noodles, so my boyfriend who ordered it was disappointed.

We were only told that no cards were accepted for checks under $30, so one of us had to cash out in a nearby bank immediately. We wondered why we didn't get any notice of it before being seated or ordering.

Overall, the food quality and service disappointed me. There a/c wad low and it's feels dull in the restaurant while most of the servers carry a heavy smell of cigarettes. It is not likely that I will come back again.",2,0,2,0,0
"Lots of takeout orders on a Wednesday night, but the restaurant was practically dead at dinner time. Only one family was dining, and they weren't Asian - not a good sign.

We ordered a medley of dishes; sweet & sour chicken, green onion beef, sauteed spinach with garlic, and kung pao tofu. Everything was uniquely flavored, but everything missed the mark. The after taste to the sweet & sour chicken was bitter-metallic; the beef had a very weird consistency; the spinach was under-seasoned; the tofu was wet. 

Portions are decent, but price is extremely high, and we didn't even get rice with our order (nor did they ask).

"Stopped by at almost 6 pm on a Friday night of a holiday weekend and there was not a single customer in the entire restaurant. Odd.

Needless to say left without trying the food (which based o. The other reviews is a good thing) and won't be back.

"Came here last week for a chicken pesto sandwich. Online details show they open at 11:00am. I got there around 11:30am, entered and approached the counter. Only after a minute or two, a young man came out from behind the counter and asked me if (insert lady's name - I can't remember it) is helping me. I told him no and that he was the first person helping me. He said that he was heading to school and then another man came out. They spoke in a language other than English and I deciphered the word Abierta (close to Spanish version of closed).

The other guy didn't want to even acknowledge my presence. The young man apologized for him and that was the sum total of my experience.

So, it happens that the hours of operation for a business can change. However, the front door was open. Bad business and a turn off for me.

It got a 2-star only because the young man provided some level of customer service.

The 10 cents is not the point, but do they do this to everyone? Pad their bottom line with a few extra cents from every transaction?? I'm going to dispute the 10 cents.

Fuck this place!! I will never eat there again and I'd highly recommend everyone who paid via CC do an audit cause these mf'ers probably overcharged you as well!

Taste wise? I can definitely see myself crave this if I'm ever feelin in the mood for some Chinese take out. It's more fusion, so I really like the combination of flavors. Their garlic fries???

Service is mediocre. It's like a Chinese frat house in there. The guys are relatively young, college-aged I assume. They weren't rude, but their appearance was unappetizing. I'm more used to a restaurant uniform, even if it's just a logo'd t-shirt. Adds to a perception of cleanliness.",2,0,3,1,0

I was completely done at this moment and luckily Mike came by. I explained to him how long we've been waiting and he took care of us. Mike brought out our wings and comped the wings for us. While getting up to leave, our server finally came out and brought out another order of wings which they let us keep.

I don't care if you're in Montclair and they make the restaurant look nice and ""fancy"" compared to some other Thai restaurants. What they are lacking is decent and consistent customer service. Their portion sizes are horrible, especially considering their prices. I can go to Tuk Tuk in Berkeley and get way more food for half the price- and honestly the taste and customer service is always ten times better. 
Daughter Thai needs to fix their portions and their prices. The price of soup has gone up over $4 in 3 months. How?! Why?! You're not offering a larger size or more/better of anything. Check out my ""large"" Tom kha soup for $21. GTFOH!!!!!! And that's veggie, so if you're a meat eater- plan on paying more than that.

The shish combo plate...I've never seen ""yellow"" short grain rice. I think the place went cheap and opted for normal rice. Using short grain, the rice tasted wet and not flavorful.
Finally, the yogurt dip. We had to ask for it. What we were provided with was some thick concoction that did not flow smoothly or enhance the flavor of the meats.

The soup, salad, bread and butter came next. The soup was fine - a decent, normal minnestrone. The bread was stale; I made it through maybe one slice. The blue cheese dressing was almost flavorless, which similarly made it hard to get through my salad.

Finally, the main course came out. Again, the problem was mainly that both the pork chops and the vegetables were very bland. Ended up making liberal use of the sauces that came with my crabcakes to make it through the food.

Got their signature dish of lamb soup to go which was $9 . 

Cash only for purchases under $10 ( I think )

Soup broth was savory however the portions of the other stuff in the soup was wanting ( see pic). Decent spot and friendly service but probably not a place I'd come back to.",2,1,2,1,0
"I want to say, I really wanted to like this place. I love supporting local businesses. I was starving. 

But, while there's a huge variety of ""flavors"" to choose from, they don't taste all that vastly different (spicy garlic vs. mild spicy). 

Location: conveniently located in downtown across from City Hall Rotunda and in same shopping center as Luckys. 

Service: Friendly and inviting - will say it was empty. Person was there alone serving as cashier and cook, I believe - so despite it not being busy, it was pretty slow. But I figure, at least the food is fresh!

Venue: It was clean with a few tables to sit at TVs to watch. When we were there, music videos were playing Latin pop - upbeat, high energy music. 

Food: It was fresh and hot, just not that great. I would compare their chicken strips to something you would get in a school cafeteria. The wings were really no better, just drowned in the sauce requested....ugh. Fries were the best thing we ordered, but were only ok, at best - and recall, we were starving!

Wish I had better things to say about the food, as I really wanted to support this place. Stars are for location/venue and service. Can't, in good conscience, tell someone I like to eat there. 

I hope it was just what we ordered or that it was an off day!",2,0,1,0,0
"Really disappointed I had a horrible experience here. Came here on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't even need it as it was not busy at all. Our waitress, Stephanie, was not attentive and had such a sour attitude throughout the night. After drinks and appetizers, we decided we didn't want to proceed with ordering entrees. To make things more awkward, after asking for the check and simply wanting to leave as quickly as possible, the hostess realized there was a note on the reservation stating it was my birthday. So, Stephanie was forcibly asked to bring a birthday dessert to our table. All in all, I won't be returning here, even if the food might be that great.",1,0,0,0,0

Their Arroz Caldo (chicken porridge) was super salty. All I could taste was the msg. 

For take out, I do not recommend getting the combo silog. The combo portion is ridiculously small. I got the sisigsilog (minced chicken with pork) and paresilog (tenderized beef) combo. They hardly gave me any sisigsilog (see the image attached - the piece of lemon is bigger than the sisigsilog). I paid $4 extra for less than a spoon of food.

"Not thoroughly impressed with this place. While I would say there are some decent qualities it's an overall meh location despite the highly rated reviews and busy location.

To start off, my family ordered four dishes and an appetizer. We ended up with five dishes as one of our ordered was incorrectly inputted. The small grip I had with this is that we were still charged for a dish we didn't order but was delivered. Nevertheless, objectively the food was decent but warranted a 2.5 star at best.

We had one of their more signature dishes, Chairman Mao Stew Pork Hock. While the dish was quite appealing and very impressive to see it was a bit too fatty on the sides of the hock. In fact, probably about 50% of it was fat that wasn't well seasoned so it just had the texture of fat without too much flavor added on. Additionally, there were very few bok choys lined on the side which was a quite a bit disappointing as it was simply one bok choy cut into fourths. 

From here, we had their steamed spareribs with sticky rice and corn. It was reminiscent of Cantonese ""joong"", which is basically a steamed sticky rice dish wrapped in a banana leaf. The difference here was the rice was too over cooked and had the texture of a paste. Given that this was the first dish to come out, I would say it was already pre-prepared which indicates it's not made to order. I wouldn't recommend this dish unless they cook the rice properly so it's not a giant paste.

Past those dishes, I think their best dish but not by a lot was their toothpick lamb. Unlike the others, it was the first dish to have enough seasoning to not blend into the rest of the dishes. It had a nice little kick from the spicy peppers but also a dry aromatics from the sesame seeds. Nevertheless, it still failed to hit the mark. The lamb was too dry and left a burning sensation after a few bites. It needed some fat to coat the lamb meat just to ensure the meat wasn't over cooked. 

Overall, I couldn't really speak too much about these dishes since there were all very mediocre. I've definitely had much better variants around the Bay Area. Ultimately, besides being a little salty about being charged for the incorrect dish the dishes lacked the punch and seasoning to really be a place I'd recommend.

TL;DR food was quite meh overall. charged us for a dish we didn't order despite bringing it up to the server.",2,1,0,0,0
"Where to start...

Parking is a hassle. They have a row for valet parking but it was full upon our arrival. There is street parking but if you don't go early enough, it's hard to find something close by. We parked a few streets up which was about a 7 minute walk (not bad at all). 

Entering the restaurant, we weren't greeted, just asked if we wanted to seat inside or wait 90 mins for outside seating. We elected to eat inside instead of waiting. 

We were provided water in a wine glass and a nice bottle to refill our water ourselves. I ordered the hibiscus Arnold Palmer, which was really good. (Make sure to mix it first) My fianc����� ordered the hard cider and he said it was good. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was delish. Came out at a decent time too. 

This is when it took a turn.
For the main dishes. I ordered the New York strip and the mash potatoes. I didn't eat any of the fried onion on top of the steak. The chopped green beans were ok. I asked for my steak to be medium well andoser to well done. (See pic below) Overall my steak was ok. The mash potatoes were good with a nice garlic taste. The steak cost $39 and the mash was $5 something.

My fianc����� ordered lake burger, he said it was ok. He had better for cheaper. For cheese or onions, you have to pay an extra $2. The burger came with a side of fries which tasted average. 

We docked stars for the restaurant because our wait for the food. We waited for an hour for it to come out. And within the hour, no one came to check on us or even give us an update on our food. They also took awhile to give us our check. The restaurant has so much potential with the location and the atmosphere. I wouldn't come back due to service and wait time for food.

"Came with a party of 6 for one of our friend's farewell celebration. By far the worst experience and here are the reasons: 

1. Poor hygiene: find a hair in one of our order, something inside the cup and food flies flying around.

2. Waiters ignored us and acted like we don't exist. Got seated at around 7pm. At around 7:30pm we finally got our food. Once the food was here, both electric stoves stop working. We informed the waiters more three times (there were only two waiters working and the max capacity for the restaurant was about 49 yet at the time not all seats were filled) about the electric stoves issue. First time, the waiter took a look at the electric stoves and he walked away!! Wtf!!! We waited assuming that he was working to fix the issue. But nope... asked the same waiter second time and he took at look... attempted to fix it and then he left... yup he just walked away without giving us a status update or offer to move us to another table (there were two other big tables available). On our third attempt, we asked another waiter and he took more than 10 mins to fix it....and it was already 8pm. Also, they didn't even apologize until one of friend said, ""I like it how they didn't even attempt to acknowledge our presence or apologize for the long wait"" to us. 

3.Had to asked more than five times for water throughout that 1 hour of wait time for food + fixing the electric stoves. Yet, they serve the other customers water literally right after they seated. Anyways, finally got our water at around 8pm... 

4. Charged us for rice that we never received!!! We had to asked them twice to fix that problem...

Probably only had one cook and a lot to food to prepare; so our food was rushed. No music, very dull. The place is nice and clean I'll give them that. Wanted to send all the food back but I can see the waitress already overwhelmed and we were so hungry, waiting so long, so we decided to suck it up and just eat the food & drink the flat beer.

"We came because this concept of hot pot, grilled meat, and steamer in one was impressive. It was all looks and not worthy of the experience. The table had built in burners and range hooks above similar to other KBBQ, the weird part was we did not use any of them. The famous three tier hot pot was cooked on a hot pot burner like at home. The steam was everywhere. They gave us spaghetti ladels to scoop food from the bottom. The was huge and difficult to get food out. Unusual. 

The meat was standard so that's fine.

The assorted vegetables plater was not complete. We asked the waiter what assortments were in this combination and he listed and we ordered. Unfortunately, another waitress wasn't able to tell the difference between Napa cabbage and Roman lettuce. We told her and she brought Napa cabbage and said these are free. I just gave a smirky smile and said thank you.

"I usually don't write reviews but I believe in running a good business practice especially in a small business because there's more visibility from the owner to make changes if needed. 

The food was ok (nothing special) but my review is based on my experience with the owner when my girlfriend and I went to dinner this evening to try out a new dumpling restaurant in the Richmond district. 

While we we're waiting on our food, the owner came by to offer us to try the ""Special Pickled Cucumber with Black Fungus"" coming off as a complimentary item on the house. His exact words were, ""Do you guys want to TRY some special picked cucumber with black fungus?"".

We figured, oh that's pretty good customer service considering they're a new restaurant in the neighborhood. When we received the bill, we noticed there was a $6 charge on top of what we ordered and realized it was the item that the owner suggested after we placed our order. 

We're disappointed and appalled by the owner towards how he handled our experience. I'm sharing what happened tonight (10/2/2019) to spread awareness and shed some light to the owner to be mindful of how he delivers his messages. The family next to us also experienced the unexpected $6 ""Special Pickled Cucumber with Black Fungus"". They also didn't seem too happy of this. BEWARE!!!! Sketchy business practice!!

"Visiting a restaurant that has just opened is always a tricky thing. We had quite an experience here this evening. 

We entered the restaurant at 7:15, and everyone seated appeared quite lost (and hungry). We waited for a while before someone finally came and showed us to a table. We were then forgotten. I overheard several people repeatedly asking for menus and calling out to the staff to place their orders. Like the others, we too spent several minutes trying to get someone's attention so we could ask for menus. Finally, the server came by and told us that they did not have enough menus. To me, this seems ridiculous! Why would a restaurant that seats 40+ people stock fewer than ten menu cards? I'd be okay even seeing a temporary printed sheet with today's specials if they hadn't finalized the entire menu. The icing on the cake? After this conversation, the server found a menu card and gave it to a table that entered much later than us. That was the last straw, so we got up and left.

The guy brought over some bread and butter with waters; and I can say they stayed on top of making sure our water glasses were full. I felt dehydrated in there, didn't feel like there was good enough air flow. The restaurant is very dated and I felt like we were dining at a closed down Burger King turned fancy restaurant.

If you do visit; I do recommend the escargot ! They were yummy! I almost ordered a second round of them! As for the coconut prawns they weren't anything special to write home about. Careful when reading through the menu because I thought I ordered the lobster with the filet minion. After i put my order in is when i realized that it wasn't coming with a steak because the server didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked ! There was a bit of a wait between food times when our food came out. I had ordered the lobster dish and my partner ordered the kind crab leg, shrimp and mussel chippino. 

I took a bite into the lobster and I was grossed out by it, it honestly tasted like ear wax; no joke! I had a bite of the rice that was on my plate and it was cold so of course I couldn't eat my meal. I pushed my meal aside and my partner knew it wasn't a great experience for me. They took the plate; apologized for me not liking it and offered to get me something else but i politely declined and I wasn't feeling the establishment anymore. The chippino I personally would give it an 7.5/10; I'm not a big fan of the tomato base broths that come with it; but I can tell you that the pasta and all the seafood inside it was cooked awesome!

"Certainly less than 'A-OK' but nothing more than OK. There are better dumplings around but all those experiences have not wow'd me at all. Truth be told that I'm having a hard time trying to enjoy time eating out. For me it's about satisfying the need of getting something to eat and not having to clean up after myself. Din Tai Fung is not one of those places. But when offered to check the place out on my sister's reservation, who am I to say 'no'.

We arrived early with her kids in tow and were promptly seated. Not a fan of seeing staff crank out dumplings as you walk in. Seems a bit exploitive and reminds me of that scene in New Jack City when Pookie infiltrated the CMB. A dark warren of tables with lots of wood throughout, we were seated in an area not too far from the kitchen door. A little annoying as the doors did not remain shut and you can see back of the house going about their business. Speaking of, the waitstaff was busy going about keeping on top of the customers. Our server and her co-workers were friendly enough. Service was polished albeit scripted. You could almost sense that there was a metric in play to keep customers happy and yet ensure the tables keep moving. Reminded a little bit of Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential and Sweet Bitter on Ovation in that there is a bigger narrative that we should be aware of. Our orders were pretty basic; pork and crab XLB, pork XLB, suimai, spicy noodles, sesame noodles and marinated cucumbers, string beans and pork fried rice. I won't going into it too much except that the food was ok if not a little flat in flavor. Again if you're coming to get full, this won't do it for you. All the items were pretty one dimensional and the only surprises were the spicy noodles and the green beans which were somewhere between just between al dente and crispy. Unfortunately we polished off all the dishes so we missed out on a pretty cool looking doggy bag.

"First time going, and it'll definitely be the last. There were less than 15 people in the restaurant eating dinner when I went with my boyfriend (that's including us) and it seemed to have a very slow energy. It was hot and musty in the restaurant, which we then realized was due to a broken AC. Still, no fans on and no ventilation. 

There were three girls that looked like teenagers who were basically running everything, and by the look and feel of the service we got, they were probably cooking the food themselves too. As soon as we walked in, we were told to seat ourselves wherever, which I didn't mind. But then we waited a good 10 minutes before any one of them brought us a menu to look at. She didn't even bother to offer any drinks. 

A different girl then came by about 10 minutes later and asked to take our orders for food (still disregarding the drinks). We ordered our food, then I had to remind one of them that we still haven't been offered drinks. And I hate to admit it but when I ordered an alcoholic drink, I took out my ID thinking she needed to check it and she said she didn't need to see it. Mind you, I just turned 21 and look like a 13 year old little girl when I don't wear makeup, which I wasn't this day. BIG YIKES! 

The food finally came. We ordered combo #3 which consisted of shrimp, king crab, mussels, sausage, corn and potatoes with the mild combo seasoning. We also ordered a side of the lobster tail with the same seasoning. The crab was big, but it didn't taste fresh. The shrimp seemed undercooked as the shell didn't peel off good on a few of them and some were still on the chewy side. The mussels were bitter. The potatoes were also VERY undercooked. The lobster was the only decent part of our order of food, but the seasoning made it bad. It was as if they mixed a gallon of oil with Old Bay, Garlic and the lemon pepper seasoning. It was so heavy on the stomach that we couldn't finish eating it. AND it was room temperature warm, not freshly cooked warm. On top of that, the most important tool in any restaurant like this, we weren't given crab crackers!!!! Just old office scissors. The crab was super hard to crack too. 

As for the rest of our service, we were never checked up on. We finished our waters and they never came to refill them. When I walked to the bathroom to wash my hands since they also don't provide wet towelettes, all three girls were on their phones up at the front giggling and eating a burger and other food that looked like they don't offer there. One of them was on Snapchat recording what they were doing. When my boyfriend got up to go wash his hands, he said they left the girls bathroom door open and all three girls were in the bathroom taking pictures with the mirror in there. We were never brought our checks either. They seemed like they really didn't want to be there and showed that they didn't care for their customers as they should of. Not once did I see a different face from other staff (cooks, buss boys, management/owners).

This place needs to go under a complete transformation, starting with management and ownership of the restaurant following with their staff. This was the worst $100 I've ever spent on food. If the food was decent i wouldn't even bother writing such a negative review. If the service was better then it would of made up for the poor quality of the food as well. How are the food AND the service both complete trash??? I had good expectations coming here since we were trying something new and I only wish I could go back to actually read the reviews and stick to eating a Rockin Crawfish instead, which is right across the street. I have worked in the food industry. I work in management currently, so I understand the frustrations that can come from starting a new business and making it a great one, but whoever this lazy owner is needs to just sell the place and find another way to invest his money in. This place is horrible! PLEASE!! Go across the street to Rockin Crawfish if you want to eat cajun seafood out in this side of the bay.

1: Terriyaki steak: the first skewer was declicious. The sauce is perfect. However the next 3 skewers were VERY TOUGH to eat. They were Like hard Beef Jerky.

2. Crab puffs: Excellent flavor and perfect frying job.

3. Egg roll with combo prawns and pea pods plate and fried rice with barbecue pork: The eggroll was so incredibly greasy I had to literally squeeze out the oil with a napkin to even eat it. The prawns were not horrible but the rice was not well made and the barbecue pork was meh. The sauce they used with the prawns made the entire concoction inedible. Mushy, bland, and the peapods were OLD. I cook chinese and Tai food at home and grow tai basil and eggplant so I know what old is. HOrrible. The dish tasted very ""off"" as in ""something in the food was old or not fresh. Threw it out. 

4. FUN/Barbecue pork. This pork literally was HARD and OLD and flavorless. They clearly overcooked it until it was inedible. I go to the best dim sum places ( NEwport off Wolfe rod in Cupertino and VALCO in Cupertino as well as Ranch 99) and this pork should have been thrown out. The FUN noodles were GOOEY and BLAND. Couldn't eat it. 

To sum it all up, although some people like certain things I would be HIGHLY unlikely to order anything but the crab wontons again. If the owners read this, please, GET your act together. Only feed your customers the freshest ingredients and dont feed them OLD food. Ty.",2,0,1,0,0
"1. The service is disorganized. The waiters run around like confused kids. They charge $18 for a bare mediocre burger and yet act like it's a cheap diner in their service model. We had approximately 4 people bringing items to our table. I had zero idea who to address as my waiter. Also, the men ""waited"" on us, all 4 of them, were without grace, to put it lightly. More like lost fisherman or bear hunters. They banged down my iced tea and meal. Also, is it so hard to keep track of who ordered what when there's only 2 people at a table? That's why you number the seats & pay attention. Maybe too complex for them. 

2. The food is overpriced. Very overpriced. Example: if you wanted a burger with cheese and avocado, it'd cost you $22. That's pretty high-fallutin' for a disorganized, ugly bar deep in El Cerrito. They be confused. 

3. The food made my stomach upset.

"When I arrived my wait wasn't even long. Maybe 15 minuets or so. It's lunch time on a Monday afternoon. We are seated a party of 3. I'm super excited because it's my first time dining here. 

The waiter explained how to order and if i needed help to flip the license plate from run Forrest run to stop Forrest stop. Nice.. So we give him our orders then it took a while for our food to come out. During that time our waiter brought a new waiter to the table and stated that he would be taking over. I'm thinking ( oh a shift change... NOT)

So after a long time our food came out. We ordered 2 platters with fish, chips and shrimp, 1 side caesar salad and another order of fish and chips.

Our fries were not hot, my friend never received her salad. when we asked the person that brought out the food they offered a refund on the fries and would see about the salad..... She never returned. So now we are waiting for someone else to help. We catch a random person and he calls my friend a sir.. Um ho she's a ma'am... Anyway can you check on the fries. 

The new waiter comes back.. He will comp some hot fries ( that's all we wanted any way) and takeoff the salad because the never made it. After another 20 minutes he returns without the fries and a manager. he states that he couldn't find them. So he cashed out the fries on one ticket and the salad on the other.

It's wasn't his fault that he was put in that tough spot. 

I have bad allergies and i'm allergic to cats and dogs... I'm wondering why my head hurts and i look a round and there is a dog a few tables behind me. Not good...

"9/7/19

My gf was really looking forward to coming cause it's new and it's totally her kind of food--red peppers, red oil, fire... totally her thing. But man......... you know, usually these types of Chinese restaurants put forth their best for the first few months to get people in, then slowly decrease quality. But if this is their best, man.... this is gonna be one horrible place in a year!

For one, even their menu is jacked up! They basically took 3 pages of dense print and pics, then shrunk them all to fit on 1 page (two for front and back)!!!--the English is basically illegible cause it's so small. The Chinese seems readable.

And for those that care, and yes I realize most Chinese from China don't really, but... there is pretty much ZERO service. Get this--we finished and the waiter looked at our empty table. Then 10min later still no bill. I walked up to the counter and ask for it and he nodded. 5min later STILL no bill. Then I walked up and again asked and he said something like, ""Hold on, coming."" Alright... yup, ANOTHER 5min... and FINALLY got the bill.

So forget that, I know you all care most about the food, so here you go:

(Oh, and I copied the names exactly as they are on the menu, caps and all)...

1. Steamed beef Spareribs with Black Bean Chili $16.99: So, NUMEROUS problems here: 1) these are NOT SPARERIBS. These are Korean-style cut short ribs. My gf read the Chinese to me, so I knew before hand, but for those that can't here you go. Anyway, this carp looks HORRIBLE. Check out my pics. Super cheap meat, super thin, totally cooked half a day or more ago, left out. The surface is dull and dry, clearly stale. There were more bones than meat. 1/10

2. Griddled Organic Cauliflower $12.99: Well, they probably didn't mean ""griddled"", but more like ""hot pot."" Anyway, it's more like your mom would make it. The cauliflower had an amateur browning and also seemed to have been cooked a LONG time ago. The fire didn't even last more than a few minutes, and barely heated up their food. Horrible execution. 2/10

3. Stir-fried louvers with chicken and cabbage $7.99: So YOU tell me what ""louvers"" is supposed to be??? !!!??? Yeah nm, don't. So, here's the deal, the English is 100% incorrect. The Chinese translates as ""stir fried bokchoy with dried tofu noodle."" How was it?--actually...... not bad. Vegetables were fine, maybe the tofu was a bit dry. But I did like the broth, which was thick and flavorful, with lots of garlic. 6/10

4. Rice $1.50: Not the most perfectly cooked. 3/10

Bottom line, do not bother coming if you can't read Chinese.

.......f it............. DO NOT COME PERIOD.

"I REALLY hope the owners/managers read my review here.

I came here six months ago with my friend who had just moved to the area. I held down a table outside while he went inside to grab beers and order brats for us. Roughly fifteen minutes later (and that's being conservative), he came out with two beers, and told me the brats were going to be brought out to us. Ten minutes turned into twenty, thirty, and finally forty. We tried to no avail to get the attention of the waitress, but she seemed to avoid noticing us every time we would gesture to her. Ended up having to yell to get her attention, and at that point, we just got the check and left.
Cut to last night, I was willing to try the place again. I sat at the bar and my buddy joined me a few minutes later. It took far too long for either of the two bartenders/waitresses to ask us what we wanted to drink. After getting our beers, the two bartenders engaged in EXTREMELY inappropriate conversation with one of their female friends who was sitting at the bar. They kept calling each other names like ""f*cking sl*t"", ""b*tch"", and the like. They all talked very loudly about their sex lives and the details of that. 
Finally we got the attention of one of the women to order an appetizer. She brought it out with ONE set of silverware, and after asking for a second set, it took her at least 15 minutes to bring it.
Now, I'm not one to berate servers, as I have been both a waiter and a chef, but these two women (I believe their names were Marissa and Danielle) are awful workers. If I owned that establishment and witnessed their behavior, I would have fired them on the spot.
We were not the only ones frustrated with service. Nearly everyone was making comments (loud enough for us and the servers to hear) about how terrible and slow the service was.
This place would be so cool if it had a competent staff. Brews and Brats will not receive my business anytime in the future.",1,0,5,0,0

Now for the ambience, I am sure it is nice and romantic based on what others have said, BUT if you are lead into the side extension, to your left as you enter the restaurant then please please run away, this is the brightly lit, bland extension of the restaurant where they seem to put in families with screaming kids (we did not have either a kid or a screaming person in the party).

"I'm a dedicated, honest Yelp reviewer whose reviews are uninfluenced and unbought. Moreover, if only 27 one-star reviews out of 4,125 at the time of this writing are any indication, I really hate giving out one-star reviews unless something is seriously wrong. So I regret having to write my 28th one-star review for Juanita & Maude.

I was passing through Albany at 5.15pm on a recent weekend at the start of J&M's dinner hour. After hearing so many great things about J&M, I decided to stop by and see if I could nab a seat.

I was told by the host that the restaurant was fully booked and that they couldn't take any more people, which was understandable enough at first glance given that this is quite a popular place and that I didn't have a reservation. The bar, however, was completely empty save for one customer having a drink. I asked the host if they took reservations for the bar and if he could make room at the bar, and he said no on both counts. 

So, let me get this straight: you say you're all booked for the night, but you have a whole bank of empty seats at the bar that you're arbitrarily reserving or otherwise not using, despite the fact that you say that they're unreservable.

Let me also guess: you'll probably employ the excuse that patrons with reservations would want to wait at the bar while their tables are being prepared. At that time, however, two-thirds of the venue was empty, which meant that patrons with reservations could be helped to their tables immediately, thereby bypassing the bar. There was no reason you couldn't accommodate one more person at the bar who had the ability to spend a lot while also finishing quickly, before the rest of the venue started to fill up.

Smacks of profiling and arbitrary discrimination to me. It's also not an isolated experience, as I notice another reviewer named K.S. has experienced similar treatment. I promptly walked the few steps to Zaytoon, was eagerly welcomed at their half-full bar, and happily spent lots of money there. Their win, J&M's loss.",1,13,28,14,0

"Came here for dinner with my parents to check out the lobster promotion and also get our snail fix. 

We love going to Oc va Lau in Orange County so we wanted to give this place a try. We were excited to eat here since there's not that many options for snails in San Jose (surprisingly). Despite the extremely similar name, they're nothing alike. We ordered the snails in tamarind sauce, razor clams baked with butter and onions, and 3 lbs. of lobster with noodles. The snails were super gritty, full of sand, and had no flavor. The snail meat was rubbery as well. The lobster was overcooked and tasted old. Only plus was the promotional price!

"I've been going to Tai Chi ever since they opened a few years ago. I really enjoy the flavor of the broths and the quality of the meat. This review is specifically for the experience of my most recent visit this past Wednesday. 

We came right as they opened at 5:30PM and waited for the rest of our party of 6 to be seat at 6PM. Keep in mind no other customers had come during this time. They seated us at a table that was meant for 4 people since it had 4 chairs and they added 2 more to the table. We asked if we could combine the adjacent table that was meant for a party of 2 instead so we'd be able to be seated more comfortably. We were all doing the ultimate package which included AYCE and AYCD so we definitely needed space for 6 full grown men to enjoy our meal.

We requested to add a second burner since there was no way all of us could reach a single pot, but the staff simply refused saying that you can only have one pot for every 6 people. She even made up a lie saying that these 2 person tables were not meant for hot pot. I've been here multiple times with 2-3 people where I was seated at that exact table where they brought a portable range to the table. We even pointed out the portable burners as they were out in plain sight. They also sell nothing else but hot pot at the restaurant.

We all get together once a year to celebrate the birthday of our friend who passed away a few years ago and wanted to be able to all sit at the same table. The logistics just didn't make sense and we had to settle for splitting up into 2 groups of three sitting behind one another. It really ruined our experience and they still charged us with as a group of 6 to grab the automatic gratuity. 

By the time we finished our meal was done around 7:30, the restaurant had an abundance of space still and had not even reached half capacity.

"I first noticed Aung Maylika as I filled up gas at Rotten Robbie next door. The tantalizing aroma of Asian spices drew me in and I made a mental note to try them one day. 

Fast-forward to last week when I returned from an out-of-state business trip and was craving something Asian after days of eating American food. I swear, this is an Asian thing where we can only go so long without eating Asian food. So after the wifey picked me up from Oakland Airport, we ended up at Aung Maylika for a weeknight dinner. 

Upon entering, the restaurant was half full and there were two servers. We stood by the ""please-wait-to-be-seated"" sign for at least 5 minutes before we were ushered to our seats. We were given menus and then we sat there for another 5 minutes. 

By this point I got frustrated and flagged down the male server for some water because I was dehydrated from having three whiskey gingers on my 5-hour flight. Then we ordered the fiery beef and the chicken biryani. The fiery beef was tasty. However, it was salty.

The chicken biryani was kind of weird. It had a lot of herbs going on and I think there was too much cinnamon. The plating did not make it appetizing as well. Definitely not for me.

Before leaving, I hit up the restroom. This is where I became disgusted. The way the restroom is set up and with the bright lighting, you can really see the toilets. And the bowl of the toilet was dirtier than most gas station/rest-stop bathrooms. I clearly saw feces stains and mildew. Look, if you can't keep your restroom clean, I can only imagine how hygienic the kitchen must be. Meh.

At the end of the day, the lackluster service, the disappointing entrees, and the nasty restrooms were too much. Aung Maylika is definitely not a ""superstar"" Burmese restaurant.

"I miss Samson and his team!! This was our go to hotpot place for myself and my boyfriend. We recently moved to Daly City but wanted to drive over on a weekday to Steamboat to celebrate our anniversary! (We love Steamboat VERY much and have celebrated a lot of special days there!) I read the recent reviews regarding change in ownership but I wanted to see for myself, hoping it wasn't true!

I made a reservation a week in advance and the person I spoke with seemed a bit disorganized; she even forgot to ask me what time I wanted my reservation to be and was about to end our call! Such a bad impression already! I came in to the restaurant yesterday and it didn't seem like they wrote down our reservation. They didn't check their calendar or have our table already set up. There was also a bit of a language barrier because none of the workers spoke English very well. They thought I had a party of 7 people when I let them know we had a reservation for 7pm.. Oh well... not a huge deal.

Customer service was not the best.. which is sad because this was a large reason why we kept coming back! Our waitress kept pushing us to order a drink after we ordered our food and we said we just wanted water. 5 mins later, she came back and said, are you sure? We have X,Y, and Z. No, woman!! I'm trying to cut down on sugar.. stop pushing me to get a drink when I explicitly said no twice! My goodness! 

I noticed that food portions were a lot smaller. My boyfriend and I would usually get full off of 2 plates of lamb, but the portions were so small that we had to order another plate. Their house sauce wasn't the same and seemed a bit watered down (their sauce was the other thing that kept us coming back!). Even when I asked for ginger, cilantro, and garlic, they came out in huge chunks. They used to come in more of a sauce form so we could mix it in really nicely with our hotpot sauce :(

Sadly, I don't think we'll be coming back to this 'new' Steamboat. It no longer makes sense for us to travel so far for hotpot. Everything we loved about Steamboat -- the manager, the people, the SAUCES, are all gone.

"So I must say, I came back here with a friend and was overwhelmed at how expensive it really is. My friend and I only ordered two meat dishes, a side of quail eggs, the dancing noodle show, and shared a pot of broth. I'm not sure why this all added up to about $90, but I felt like that was an insane bill for just two people. On top of that, there wasn't even that much food for it to be worth that much. I felt like I originally gave 4 stars because going with a larger group, I understand the bill being a little higher, but this time I just can't bring myself to believe the money I spent was really worth it here. The food is good for sure, but it wasn't amazing, and definitely wasn't $90 amazing.

"I would give them zero stars if I could. I placed a catering order for 23 people on Friday, July 19 for pick up Sunday, July 21.

The person working said he could get the order for us but it would take 1 and half hours and we would have to pay again. He also said the same thing happened the weekend before with catering orders. The link to the order status website said our order was being cooked....

"Came back today for lunch and probably won't be coming back for a while. 

Lunch for 3 people with tip was $100. 

Fried artichoke - This was soggy and not crispy. It was basically artichoke hearts out of a jar, battered and deep fried. Nothing you can't do at home better. 

Linguine with clams - Flavor was ok, but it only came with a few clams.

Baked ziti and meatball - The cheese on here was so rubbery, it was hard to chew through.

Chicken alfredo - Really bland.

The pasta didn't taste fresh, and all of it was cooked mushy. 

The reason we came was for the floating dessert, but they don't serve it on weekdays anymore. 

At $35/person for lunch, I felt like the food quality was really poor. Service we had to keep flagging people down. 

For the same price, I'd say Trattoria 360 in Campbell has way better quality.",2,0,2,1,0

"Sizzling crispy fly. So gross to look down at my chopstick and instead of seeing a Sichuan pepper I looked close and saw a little crumpled fly with only a few legs left and a broken wing covered in mild sauce. This is actually not the first time we found weird things in our food here. 

Last time my girlfriend found a hair in her pot and the lady said, ""it's okay that's normal"" lol. So apparently if you can catch a fly in your food they're worth up to 20% off your meal :rolleyes: We come here because we live close but by no means is this place ""a hidden gem"".

FOOD: I ordered Fries (they were Dry and plain) 
Lomo saltado which look very delicious but was not. The meat was not well done like I had asked and the flavor was very plain. The fries that were on top of the meat were very good! It's also way overpriced. I don't mind spending money on good food, this wasn't it. 

Customer service: I would say it was an OK experience. We were able to sit at our table promptly. The waitress took some time to come and take our order.

"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, great location, beautiful place, a hidden gem that I recommended to everyone but this is the last time that I will go back. Eight of us went to celebrate two birthdays and when I found out the previous chief has left and the menu has changed I was not disappointed but was still optimistic that the food would be good. It took a long time to get our food and the food came out cold because ""the kitchen was backed up"", the food was tasteless, our glasses were not clean and had to get our drinks taken back. Our waiter seems to be new on the job but did his best to get us served so he was the only positive experience. I think it was the manager who came to our table few times and took the food back and knew that I did not get my potatoes but instead of taking responsibility for how slow her kitchen was and how bad the food was she blamed the waiter for his slow service. The last time I checked waiters serve what they are given, they don't cook the food. I never got my potatoes, steak had to be returned and the eggs were not good at all.
Out of eight orders the only items that were good were the burgers, so if you are in area go for the burgers but not worth driving there for it either.

first time was a great experience...staff was great and service was quick for a to- go order. I got my food in half the time, 10mins, when the cashier said it would take, 20mins.

First off, they ran out of fries a wing place with no fries....that should have been the first red flag that today was not the day to get wings from here. to make matters worse for me was that, it was quite busy and every person that placed an order after me got their food first....the cashier couldn't explain why patrons that were eating there were getting their food before me when they ordered after other than the cooks were making my wings fresh...quite disappointed",2,0,0,0,0
"I had never heard of Golden Corral before, but since they've opened, the lines outside have been pretty long. We chose a Monday night for dinner to avoid the crowds. There were no lines, but it was still packed inside.

Unfortunately, that night the place smelled horrible. I couldn't even focus on my food because the stench was so overwhelming. At first, I thought maybe it was BO from the crowds, but then my daughter had to go to the bathroom and that's where I found the source of the stench. I almost died in there. It smelled like a porta potty and the odor was permeating into the dining area. We were sitting pretty far from the restrooms, but it was hard to eat and breath through my mouth at the same time and I just lost my appetite. 

Miraculously though, I seemed to be the only one bothered by it. My family said they smelled it, but they were able to continue eating through it. The rest of the crowd were also inhaling their food so maybe I'm just overly sensitive to bad smells.

I only remembered a couple of things that were decent: the sirloin steak that they grill for you, the carrot cake, the chocolate fountain where I dipped my strawberries, and the yeast bread, which was my favorite, especially when it comes out fresh. Even without the smell, I wasn't impressed by the food. 

The highlight was the people who worked there. They were all super friendly and were working so hard to clear our table and checking if we needed anything. They also didn't seem to notice the smell, but maybe they're immune by now.

Until they fix that smell, I can't go back.",2,1,4,0,0

When we finally sat down, again we waited forever for someone to come and take our order. It was not even busy and plenty of open tables. We even had to flag down a server. My kid was starving.

"The definition of insanity is essentially doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting a different result. By that assumption, I must be slightly insane for thinking this place could ever get better. Let me break it down...

Food: There is never enough of it, and when there is, it's often over-cooked or worse--cold. Waiting for something to be replenished or cooked fresh can take a friggin' lifetime! 

Atmosphere: There is always a long line... and 85% of the staff has been consistently rude. Always quick to rush me and my family through the line without actually listening to what I'm saying... only to get upset when I ask why something was forgotten, overcharged or skipped over. The restaurant������� itself is mostly clean...but when it gets busy, expect to find food everywhere on the ground (by the tables.) 

Service: It is a very time-consuming process to eat there--even if your order online. You always end up waiting longer than you should for things that should have been ready ahet hey, you get what you pay for, right? (Good deal, cheap food, only slightly above average service.)

All in all, this place could use a bit of a face-lift so to speak... Maybe one day someone will take note of when the high traffic hours are and be more adequately prepared to serve hot, decently portioned food. It would also help if the staff would be more willing to say hello or smile once in a while.

Food: We ordered the beef flavor, and it was mediocre overall, the braised potato was really good, we ordered some add-on's as well, fish balls are pretty bad comparing to other similar sizzling pot/hot pot restaurants.

Here is the skinny, 5 mins after we got seated, we right away noticed everything on our ""cleaned"" table, the water bottle, napkin dispenser, and flyer stand was grubby and covered with grease that's obviously accumulated overtime.

"This was the worst restaurant meal I've had in a while.

Portions were big, which I suppose could be a positive thing. Presentation was eye appealing.

The potatoes served with the octopus appetizer were undercooked.

The chicken was more Mexican/American South rather than Asian Fusion. A tomato-corn-black bean (not the fermented asian kind) sauce over a gigantic bed of bitter greens on top of mashed potatoes. The menu did not indicate these details, it said something like black bean chicken - which I'm down with if it was asian style. 

I might've been okay with a tex mex black bean chicken dish if I had that idea in my head. It definitely did not say it would be served with mashed potatoes - I wouldn't have ordered it if it did.

"After reading so many glowing reviews, against my better judgement my hubby and I decided to make dinner reservations here before going to see Hamilton and get some bayside time in during our day trip to SF. I had dim hopes that this would be one of those rare restaurants located in a touristy area that happens to be good, but boy was I wrong.
Reservations went smoothly and was easy to make, but it was pretty downhill from there. *to be fair, this review is mainly about the food, and not so much the location/view/service
We were seated in the ""downstairs"" area near the windows so we had a beautiful view of the bay. Definitely a plus. We were promptly greeted by a waitress who seemed very busy and a bit curt but was immediately given water and sourdough bread with butter. We decided to go classic and order a bowl of the clam chowder, Cioppino, and fish-n-chips and was blatantly disappointed in all three dishes.
Clam chowder was perhaps the least offensive- very run of the mill, nothing special, could be out of a can, chowder.
The Cioppino on the other hand was a disgrace to it's legacy. The seafood was very salty (and this is coming from a girl who loves salt!) which was a bit of a red flag since usually if seafood is over salted, it's not fresh. Fish, shrimp, mussels, they all tastes SO salty.The tomato based soup on the other hand was bland and the whole dish was clearly just for the looks and not at all about quality or flavor.
Fish and chips... who thought you could royally mess up fried food? Well, it happens here. Fish had way too much batter (it was so strange, the outside was crispy, and then there's a second layer of batter inside was soggy, how's that even possible?!), and it was very dry. The batter nor the fish had any seasoning on it so we sprinkled some salt and pepper in hopes of it's recovery. Fries were also on the same boat-- flavorless. Just fried.
I really have no clue why they even have a to-go stand outside, I've had much better fried food from just a regular humble food truck. I would not recommend having dinner at this establishment, especially when there's so much better eateries in SF!",1,0,0,0,0

The reason for the low rating is the lunch menu, complete lack of presentation, Miso soup came in late (after salad and rice !) and how they platted the Chicken teriyaki I can swear if I did it at home it would have been more presentable.

We were there at 11:40 and left by 12:30 and during all that time we were the only ones there and there were lots of workers delivering things into the restaurant...so not very pleasant.

"Sad to say my experience was like Ron O's post (or part of it) had to do with poor training. 
I didn't see the unsanitary issues he did. But our server was brand new to food service and the manager was watching / visiting with our waitress, but not noticing our poor service from her and the three bartenders working that night. (Who BTW could not keep up with our table of four. It was a weeknight and NOT busy and we were not drinking heavily- they just were inattentive and agonizingly slow.).
The waitress did not write our orders down. Told us they were out of one thing, then came back and said- oh we do have it after all. Did this twice on the drink order and once on the food menu. Not a confidence builder even if you have an amazing memory.
 And another server made the effort to come followup to see what the entire tables order was. But it was clear, no one was actually training her that evening, nor was she shadowing anyone, if this indeed was her first job.
Even with me taking the manager's (or supervisor's) photo, pretty obviously I might add. Neither he nor the waitress came over to check on us without use flagging them over.

Please managers, train your people. Isn't this your bread and butter? Don't you want your your business to thrive, and you instead leave it in the hands of the unskilled or untrained?

Throughout the last couple of years owner is there during the rush and is depending on couple of servers that does not do justice to this place, yes they are short staffed at times but only for no more than 40mins within a small dinner rush, the male server always give a negative vibe to his customers, always neglect guest or if guest goes up to him to ask for stuff like a fork or missing items, he would rely ""can't you see I am swamp and I can't get to you now"" leaving customers with a bad vibe, the female server on the other hand tries hard but forgetful at times.

Now onto food items, quality had definitely seen better days, baked dishes are no longer moist but rather dry as Mojave desert, meats are rubbery, chow fun are all stuck together, etc to make things worst, I ordered the large size 1 liter lemon tea that I have been drinking for over 10 years from both places, male server came by and ask me what size do I want ? Their small jugs are sometimes glass sometimes plastic, he ended up being out the jumbo size jug that can fill a table of 6........omg just how much lemon tea can 1 person drink ?????

I think it's common sense that if someone goes to a restaurant, the employees can recommend you with options that they know and based on their knowledge of what are the best choices.",1,0,0,0,0
"Love the old school diner vibe and atmosphere of this place, but the burgers just didn't cut it for me. We arrived at 5:30pm and the place was super busy. There was a wait for the booth seating but the bar was open so we opted to sit at the bar. Big mistake! We got seated right in front of the grill and I got pretty overwhelmed with all the greasy and oily smells. Avoid sitting at the bar in front of the grill if possible. 

Got the baby burger with cheese ($7.95+$0.25) and the chili cheese fries ($7.55). We asked for the burger to be cooked medium, but when it came out it was rare - the inside of the patty was really pink and dripping with red juices that were soaking into the bun! Had to ask our waitress to bring it back and cook it some more. When it came back the 2nd time, the meat was cooked, but the bun was still soaked in red blood - didn't even bother switching out the buns. I end up just tossing the bun and had my burger low carb. I liked the char of the burger from being cooked on the grill, but having been served a rare burger when I asked for medium just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The chill cheese fries were average. I liked the wedge fries, but the chili tasted plain.

More so than that, if you ever come here and Dallas is your waitress, ask for her to be replaced immediately. She's rude, impatient, condescending, passive aggressive and will ruin your dining experience. 
Once we spoke to her manager (who is great, btw), he was very apologetic and even gave us complimentary champagne to make up for the poor experience we had with her. It was a lovely gesture, but unfortunately not enough to undo the trashy service that Dallas provided. Most likely won't be back.",2,0,2,0,0

"First shift's service is horrendous.
Do NOT come before 5pm.

I came here with 5 friends for my Birthday Celebration. Let's just say Kickin Crab should kick the curb. Place was more than 1/2 empty when we sat down on Saturday 10/05 around 3.15pm. We left at 6pm.

Horrible service.

S L O W and nonchalant and carelessness amongst all the servers there. Unfortunately they were all too busy chatting amongst themselves or standing around aimlessly. Maybe they were not trained properly, or trained improperly. We asked several times for good service and were ignored.

The table of 4-5 people behind us got there later than we did, and were served their meals before we were.

--15 minutes to place order.
-- 30 minutes later to get 2 of our 5 meals and sake. We had to ask for sauce on the side twice, and wait 15 minutes for that.
-- Another 30 minutes past before we received the other 3 meals and replacement sake. When we asked why it took so long, they excused it because they said there were busy fulfilling carry-out orders. REALLY??! Learn to do business and get your priorities right.
-- We are given only 3 seafood crackers to share amongst 6 people. The restaurant is about 60% empty. No gloves were given. No wet naps until we asked. No utensils were given until we asked (plastic knife, spoon & fork). No water or drinks refilled until we asked.
-- Billing takes an additional 20 minutes, and the server has changed shifts. Second shift comes on and we complain, and the new server was nice and tried to help us. We were comped the drinks and sauces. REALLY?!! Oh, the pens they gave us to sign the bills were leaking ink and exploded on my friend's face. Yes, really. Sums up this place.
-- Large flies kept coming around when we were dining. Dirty bathrooms. Just unkempt overall. Where's management??
-- FYI, the food was tasty.

Not worth the 3 hour experience. Worst restaurant/service I've experienced. I also told them it was my birthday and they did not come sing at our table, while they did to the one close to us. Nothing made sense at that restaurant.

"It is a shame that a consistent review of five stars from me would demote to one star, maybe zero star! Came here for dinner and it was a very slow night. The mood that night was starting to get gloomy. 

So I went ahead and ordered Pad Woon Sen $13.95. Choice of fish, silver noodles, egg, carrots, celery, mushroom and white cabbage. When it was served, the food presentation itself is poor, small portion for a price that is steep and the taste is horrible. Very bland!! The pan-fried sole fish tasted banal, the noodles and vegetables tasted equally flat. The overall texture of the food is poor quality. In order to fix it, I asked for lime wedges, the server gave me a pathetic small size of lime wedge. You bet, it didn't help! There was zero lime zest. I asked for soy sauce. it is very potent! Poured just a little bit. Still, it is very bland! I became depressed to even swallow the food. Early on, I asked for drinking straw. I was given one but already exposed and was carelessly placed on my table. Tacky! No way I am gonna use that!

Strongly advise: Do NOT order Pad Woon Sen!

And oh, none of the servers asked how I was doing. I already paid when I told the two servers the food is bad and bland! One server did apologize to me.

"I like Lers Ros in general and have ordered Lers Ros (and Esan Classic) on Uber Eats probably 10+ times in the past couple of years that I've lived in SF, but dining in at this location misses the mark.

On my most recent visit, my friend and I both ordered pad see ew. Anyone that has cooked a dish with flat rice noodles before knows that the cooked noodles prior to stir-frying often clump and stick together (imagine sticks of gum pressed together lengthwise) and should be separated before stir-frying. My mom often assigned me this task in the kitchen while she was preparing the similar Chinese/Cantonese dish ���������������������������. When this isn't done properly, the result is what Ler Ros served to me - clumpy noodles yielding inconsistent bites, some significantly denser and blander than others.

You might think that complaint is a little nitpicky. After all, separating clumped rice noodles is a tedious job and it took me much longer to do it as a kt. You'd be right.

However, my friend's pad see ew had multiple pieces of eggshell in it - 3 different bites, I think. Overall, the quality control was just seriously lacking. We also ate at 5:30 when it was fairly empty, so no excuse for oversight due to haste.

I've had enough dank late night delivery meals from Lers Ros to give it another chance for sure, but probably not this location again (come to think of it, I'm pretty sure I always ordered delivery from the Mission and Larkin locations. Go to those ones, or Esan Classic).",2,0,0,0,0

Then again, maybe I was unlucky because I was not very impressed. I got the Giant Super Burrito (don't let the name fool you because it's regular sized). I must say I was underwhelmed. I got carne asada and it just didn't have any flavor. Well maybe it did, it may have just been masked by an exceedingly large quantity of refried beans that dominated the taste of the burrito.

"BINGS AND DIN DING COMPARISON. 


XLB- I understand that there should be at least eighteen folds on every dumpling for a true XLB, but the tops of these piping hot dumplings were hard. The casing was very tough and the meat was DRY. How can that be when it's surrounded by soup? It was over cooked in its own broth like the white meat from a dry turkey on thanksgiving. Bings casing held the soup without breaking down and the meat and broth are flavorful. 

Wonton in chili oil- The casing for this dumpling is also wrong. The wrapper is supposed to cling to the meat in wontons and be soft when served. However it was like the wonton was filled with air and therefore made the casing hard. The chili oil lacked salt and heat. I could have just been food colored oil. The meat was also flavorless. Bings wonton in chili oil is soft and veryyyy fresh. It has a good bite to it and the oil is tasty. (No extra added chili needed) 

Spicy Cumin noodle- I have tasted better zhajangmein at other places and Din dings is almost not asian with the amount of cumin they use. It has no asian flavoring or umami flavor. It just tastes like cumin oil. Bings noodles are always nicely hand pulled and cooked aldente but their xhajangmien flavoring could be better. Still worth the try though.",2,2,2,0,0

Nice location with outside seating. It was too hot to sit outside, so we opted to stay in the air condition dining area.

Fine, so we ordered. 

Beef Empanada - two small empanada for $8. Flavor was there, but empanadas were the smallest I've seen and early any meat. Also the crust were burnt. 

Ceviche- Salty! Salty! Not even enough Lime, acid! Just salty. Seafood wasn't Fresh! Smelled fishy. Tasted the octopus and it was definitely fishy. Worse Ceviche I've ever had. Even had an upset stomach a hours later. The ceviche doesn't come with anything. We had to order a side of Platanos chips. 

Pork Shoulder Adobo - bland. All we tasted was the beans. Very small portion for $15. I don't ever mind paying the price if at least it is tasty.

"1/25 UPDATE In Response to Owner Comment: 

I'd like to clear some things up. Since you were so detailed in your response : 

When Aki made the arrangements with Katalina in person - Katalina made no mention of knowing my grandfather nor did we bring up his church standing. It wasn't and STILL isn't relevant to our transaction. We did not come to your business looking for any discounted or ""complimentary"" services. 

The pickup time was set for 10am. This was verbally agreed upon and confirmed via text message between Aki & the owner. 

The boys showed up at 9:30am. 30 minutes early. Your response makes it seem as if we were being unreasonable, and we were not. 

While it's admirable that you added 10 plates & a side- the fact is that we did not ask for it. We asked for timely delivery. And for you to then imply it was because of these complimentary items..that you were just 15 mins late?? Unacceptable. You were 2 hours late, with food we didn't ask for. 

At any rate, I thank you for your response. Although it's a month late to my original post; I understand now that that is how your business manages all of its customer response times. 

What's done is done but let's not skew the facts. 
Good luck to you and your business.",1,0,5,0,0

"Just don't come here. This place feels like a trying to be a fine dining Southern food restaurant but in reality it's a weird vibe of a 60's, 40's club with their staff dressed in capri pants/shorts. They kept the same interior as bisou bisou but I guess a different color scheme. 

They definitely need to hire more severs. Because apparently the servers are also the host, the waiter and the busser and they pull straws to see who does what. So basically when you get there you wait around hoping someone comes by to seat you. And why ask if you have a reservation? Who's reserving their seat here. It was not even full. Very limited options on the menu selections. I get they're trying to be fancy and not cutter the menu with a lot of dishes but if you're going to do that then the food should be amazing and at least warm. There are only a few complete entrees to choice from. In a business sense works for them to force people to order multiple items at a minimum of $7 for cornbread. 

I got the fried chicken. Which as described on the menu as being double dredged. It was barely dredged once. It was like they put it in flour and then put it back in flour. It was not crunchy at all nor was it even warm. It tasted like room temperature chicken. Definitely was made in advance and they pretended it was freshly made because even the sad mushy collard greens were cold. The only thing that was hot was the mac and cheese that was served in a mini cast iron. Given it was probably only hot because they had to broil the cheese on the top. So overall nothing feels freshly cooked or at the very least warmed to the correct temperature. I wonder if they just have a very slow cook staff that they took forever to bring out the food. Which is understandable if they're cooking the food as its ordered but doesn't seem like they actually cook here. Like a really bad Popeyes chicken.

They do not have a dessert menu but the waiter can recite the desserts to you. I highly doubt they all know the components of the desserts for allergy purposes but hey they can go in the back and read the label from the frozen box.

"I was so excited to see an izakaya place opened in Walnut Creek since there's no similar restaurants in downtown and I love izakaya.

We came on a weekday night and were seated promptly after we arrived at the restaurant and handed the menu. However, there were only one server serving the restaurant, so the water took 10+ min to come. 

After our server took our order, the first dish took 20+ min to come which was quite unexpected given there where not that many people in the restaurant.

The food is not worth the wait and quite disappointing. We ordered the chef's choice meat skewers and we enjoyed the gizzard and pork sausage - the other skewers were a little burnt. The sake clams were so rubbery - they were overcooked and the broth was super salty. The soft shell crab and the beef stew were the two most enjoyable dishes throughout the night. The oyako don was ok... the chicken and egg were good, but the rice was drenched in the sauce which makes the rice super soggy.

Service was so so as the server was quite busy but I can tell that she's trying her best.

We didn't want to eat Chinese food with forks so we got in our car and drove down to the restaurant to get some. Once we get home and can finally eat our food we open the containers up only to find warm food and that one of the containers was filled with so much liquid (water from the vegetables) they it leaked all over the bag and on some of the other containers. We then had to wipe them all off and microwave our plates so we could eat hot food. The food wasn't as good as we thought it would be from a place with such a good yelp rating. There wasn't much flavor in the dishes and the sweet and sour chicken was heavily breaded and somewhat soggy. We also expected a better menu to choose from. The prices aren't crazy but they're too high for what you're getting. Overall we probably won't be back. We'll stick to our usual (and favorite) spot in CV. The food here isn't worth the price and the delivery experience alone left a bad taste in our mouth. 

Summary of the experience: Paid extra to have food delivered. Selected 'pay with cash' when we ordered. Delivery man shows up with NO change. Had to run around house searching for exact cash. Open up bag to find no chopsticks. Driver has no chopsticks. We had to drive to the restaurant to get chopsticks. Come home to warm food that leaked in bag. Had to microwave food to eat hot. Finally able to eat and disappointed. Not worth it.",2,0,0,0,0
"I got the vegan/vegetarian pho and it tasted like water to me. It didn't really have much taste. I tried my best to finish all of it but ended up leaving the last bit.

If the veggie broth had more flavor, I would have been much happier and it would have been a good meal. The noodles and veggies were fine. 

This location is close to where I live so I want to come back to give their other vegan options a shot as I imagine some of the other dishes probably taste better.",2,1,1,1,0

"My husband and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a few months now. We finally found the time and had a reservation for 6pm on a Sunday night during Memorial weekend. We said with certainty that we will not come back. 

The menu is an insult to the French. I saw lots of ordinary pasta dishes at high prices. There were game meat and salads. But we thought if they can't cook simple ordinary dishes, they can't cook at all. My husband ordered the lobster ravioli. I ordered the sea bass special. Both of our dishes were $50 each and tasted like canned food quality. There were only four small raviolis, about 2"" wide sitting in a sea of creamy pesto sauce. My sea bass was over cooked so it had the texture of swordfish. The radish and carrots sat under heat lamps too long so they dried out. We couldn't bring ourselves to be disappointed with dessert so we skip it. 

Only one good thing about the restaurant, was the location. But still not worth the drive for over priced canned food.",1,0,9,0,0
"I remember when people would always rave about this place, saying it's best Izakaya in the city. I have been here 4 times now, I also live a block from this restaurant but I just don't get the hype. Some of the dishes are good, but definitely not amazing. There seems to always have a line, so definitely get a reservation especially cuz the restaurant is pretty small too. 

So far the best dishes from here are the takoyaki and salmon onigiri. I've tried their karagee cartilage, beware this is not ur typical chicken karagee, served with salt and pepper, I wouldn't order this again because it's too crunchy and hard to chew. 

The worse dish from here are the ramen. I've tried their tonkotsu and tsukemen. Both are very mediocre, the tonkotsu tastes like instant ramen noodles with very very extremely salty broth. Skip at all cost! For tsukemen just go to Iza Ramen.",2,4,7,5,0

"I tried to give it a chance and it was less than mediocre. I was really hoping the food was great because I love the saloon vibe. 
The Bad:
1. You cannot throw Buffalo hot wing sauce on some chicken pieces and call it Tennessee Hot Chicken. If you have had hot chicken from Tennessee you will understand. The batter was corn meal, I think. It just wasn't what I was expecting...at all. It was hot wing sauce doused chicken. The French fries were the better part of the plate. Sad to say. 
2. Baked Potato Soup - from a can. It was watery and they threw imitation bacon bits and sour cream in the cup and called it a day. No potato, no cream, no season. I even tried to doctor it up and it did no good. The worst baked potato soup I've had. 

The Good:
1. Cute little saloon
2. Server was attentive. Lunch was slow so this could be why, but I appreciated the service.",2,0,0,0,0

The ingredients seem all very high quality. 
That's about it. 
I came a few days ago with my coworkers, and was excited to try it, hearing many good things about this place. We ordered the fried chicken wings, shrimp crepe, papaya salad, cauliflower, and the shaking beef. 
The chicken wings had a strange lack of crispness, they were coated in a sticky sweet sauce, and seemed slightly lukewarm. The crepe looked exciting at first, the sides were nice and crispy, and the fillings seemed good. However, this dish lacked seasoning, it tastes bland after a few bites. The papaya salad and cauliflower were also mediocre. Then came the beef, I was very excited due my friend telling me this was the best dish. However, i was greeted by a over marinated soggy, lukewarm price of beef coated in the same sticky sweet sauce. It tasted like Panda Express with good ingredients. Except evenPanda Express knows to properly salt their beef. For the cost, and taste, this place is definently not worth it.",2,0,0,0,0

We ask why couldn't she just took one from the empty tables and she was like "" well we have a lot of reservations coming in"" which is absolutely a LIE not to mention the restaurant is still half empty by the time we left.

"We drove out from Hercules based on the reviews. It was around 6 on a Wednesday night and the place was about half full. The single server was overwhelmed but eventually took our orders, he was very kind and informed regarding the menu. Our food was delivered in a reasonable time and looked nothing like the pictures on the yelp page. The spouse had the carbonara with added shrimp, could not finish due to the quality of the cubed chicken. I wanted Marsala which is not on the menu and he offered to make me one. There was no Marsala wine sauce whatsoever, it was Thai peanut sauce and tasted like it was straight from a jar. My accompanying vegetables were good however the mashed potatoes seemed reheated. We spent over $70+ tip. Again the server was very kind and professional. We surmised the primary chef was on vacation or likely only works the busy weekend dinners.

"I should say I'm a special case. I have severe food allergies to dairy and eggs, but my company had a business dinner of 7 people scheduled here that I was invited to. I called ahead because of my allergies 2 days before the dinner, and the person on the phone was very friendly initially. After being on hold for 20 mins, they said I'd be able to have spaghetti or vegetables, with no butter and that they would make a note on the reservation to accommodate this and make sure it was ok. I got there two days later after making a reservation and there was no note about this so I had to reexplain to the waiter. Also, my waiter actually asked the kitchen and told me that there actually is egg in all pasta. I appreciate that he told me, but it was still a bummer to go to this spot and not be able to eat. I requested vegetables plain, but when they came out they smelled like butter and I didn't trust the restaurant so eventually I didn't eat anything. 

Overall long story but wouldn't recommend this if you or anyone you're with have dietary restrictions whatsoever. Everyone else's food did look good and filling though and the staff was nice, even if they didn't know what was in the food really.

"Terrible experience through and through.

After over twenty minutes of waiting for my overpriced gyro and watching multiple other customers get their order, I asked to have my order to go and let them know I'd be late to a meeting otherwise. They said my order was coming up. So I waited.

And waited.

Another ten minutes later I finally got my order. It clearly was never ready, and they should have given me the option of getting a refund versus waiting.

When I got back to my office to eat really quick since I had burned through 45 minutes of my lunch hour at this point... lo and behold the food was terrible.

The chicken for the gyro was lukewarm and shockingly bland. The fries were under-cooked. $20+ for garbage.

"Really rough. Super nice people, great vibe, great location, but definitely some trouble in the kitchen I hope they work out.

Ordered the fried chicken with Mac n cheese and collards. There was one piece of chicken, cut into three chunks AFTER it had been fried, and I guess all my breading fell off in the kitchen because there was barely any left. Disappointed but ok. Plate was also swimming in oil, which they said was butter from the mac n cheese and that it was normal, but the fact that the little chicken breading I did still have was now soaking in oil - too much to just suck it up. They very nicely offered to remake it, and they attempted to. 

New plate. Breading is better on the chicken this time, but there is a PILE of fried breading dumped on top. Clearly more breading than could have been attached to my chicken - The cook must have scooped ALL of the leftover fried bits from cutting up everyone else's chicken and dumped them on my plate. Whether they were overcompensating or pissed off I'd sent my plate back I have no idea. There wasn't a pool of oil this time, but the sauce on the mac had clearly broken and it was cold enough that there was clumps of unmelted cheese.

I was too horrified to complain again, so I just quietly left. I suspect the only reason to cut boneless chicken up after you fry it is if you're unsure whether it's fully cooked, but whatever the reasoning it's certainly not a good move when your breading is already dying to leave the chicken behind.",2,3,5,1,0
"The food and aesthetic was good. Their sandwiches and mussels are good but I do NOT recommended to even bother going here.

The reason why I'm taking away stars is due to the lack of respect my boyfriend and I received. We are a younger looking couple and were dressed in more causal/streetwear outfits which is completely different from the business causal attire the other customers were dressed in. We wanted outdoor seating due to us having our dog. When we walked up to the restaurant, we were not greeted even though I made eye contact with the male waiter. My boyfriend had to hunt down someone to seat us and when we were finally seated, we were placed in the back ""due to our dog"". I initially didn't have an issue with it but when we sat down I realized we were hidden and out of sight. 

Fast forward to the end of our meal after good service from the female waiter. As we were leaving, I see an older well dressed couple with their dog sitting in the front outdoor area AND the male waiter bringing out a water bowl for the dog(petty but we weren't offered a water bowl). In terms of the dog, I feel the staff thought we couldn't control our dog (even though we showed them nothing to think that) so that may have been a factor in where we were placed. No offense to the other owner but their dog was not as well behaved as ours as it was going toward other tables. But I believe the major factor was our appearance of being both appearing young and more causal dress. Maybe the staff believed we wouldn't be well behaved or possibility ruin their image but whatever it was, their decision left a bad taste in my mouth and has me not wanting to return. 

(We are also Asian and the other costumers were Caucasians. I hope that wasn't a factor in their decision to basically hide us but it was something I noticed and further irked me.)",2,0,3,1,0

My wife and I got 3 things: a miso ramen, karaage, and their coconut chicken curry ramen (this is a special).

Karaage - worst I've ever had, not exaggerating. Pieces were the size of a cashew. Some were raw inside.

Miso Ramen - normal but that's not saying much since it's hard to screw this up.

Coconut Curry Chicken Ramen - curry was ultra thick. Chicken was fried earlier and was obviously stale. No way to finish this unless you like to eat heavy whipping cream straight up.

We ordered the meat combo ($18) and a vegetarian mushroom dish ($7). Normally the meat combo is enough for my wife and I. It usually has about 5 proteins which include a few beef dishes, a chicken leg and an egg. This time no chicken leg, no egg. There was cold (out of the refrigerator cold) minced breast meat. Just a few table spoons of each item. All-in-all about 6 ounces of meat product if that. Then the mushroom dish came out and it was about 3 tablespoons of product. What's going on guys?!

"Came here yesterday to get the Hokkien Mee, which from my past experiences is not sweet. Well imagine eating the Malaysian version of Jollibee spaghetti with dark soy sauce... and you get Hokkien Mee. Not sure if my noodles were a fluke but they were overly sweet. It felt like I was eating dessert with every bite of noodles. Not exactly savory for an entree. The only mere ""highlight"" of this dish was that there were quite a few pieces of shrimp. Other than that, the Hokkien Mee was pretty outright disgusting. 

I was hoping for Azalina's as another Malaysian food options in the city. Sadly this doesn't cut it. I know that Asian food in the US tends to be on the sweeter side, which I am okay with for the most part... but the dish I had was overly sweet. From previous reviewers, they mentioned that their Hokkien Mee was too salty. Did the cook put in sugar instead of salt in my dish? 

The next best Malaysian food options are either at Lime Tree in Sunset or Ipoh Garden in Millbrae, which serve up pretty decent Malaysian food that is decently priced and cooked by those who hail from SE Asia.

We don't mind waiting and we waited about 10 minutes which was not bad. Once it's our turn to order, the cashier looks at us and they looked like they did not want to be there.

It's hard being on your feet all day, dealing with rude customers, and just being in a fast paced environment is really hard on anyone. This location has some of the worst customer service I've ever seen in any restaurant or shop. Not only are the stuff extremely rude, but they don't seem to have communication skills either.

Everything sounds great but the highlight was the bread from Firebrand or acme, plus for bread, otherwise though not much avocado but a heavy mix of miso paste and generous portions. Frankly everything was pretty a-ok but a little weird.

"Service: 2/5 Me and my wife had to wait at the entrance for 7min even though they had a few customers. The guy, the Japanese boss saw us several times but didn't care us for awhile and when he came to us to ask how many we were, he didn't apologize at all. His attitude made us angry.

Taste: 1/5 The water tastes like unfiltered tap water. Almost all of meat was too much sweet. I think they used similar sauce for the all meat and it's too sweet so it makes all the taste of meat similar and I couldn't differ the own tastes of each meat. Western people may like it but Asian people might not like it. It's neither not similar the ordinary meat sauce in Japan.

There was a FINGER NAIL in my Pad Thai. The worst part was that I was chewing it for a while and realized I couldn't break it and figured it was a shrimp skin so I spat it out.
It was definitely a finger nail (I can send photos but I prefer not to disgust anyone else). 

Anyway, I called the restaurant and they offered to re-make the meal but I've absolutely already lost my appetite. They issued me a refund (which never arrived) so I called back. 

The manager on duty said that it was a ""lemon grass"" stick and not a nail because ""WE DON'T CLIP NAILS IN THE RESTAURANT"" which is COMPLETE BS because it was a BROKEN NAIL. He kept telling me that I was wrong and that I mistaken the nail for Lemon Grass (WTF?). When I told him that this was really bad customer support because (isn't the customer always right?) he said that I was wrong (repeat reasoning above).

"Poor service & Low food quality.

I used to write reviews for every restaurant that I visited but now I typically save it for the best and the worst. For the worst, I understand restaurants that have bad/busy/down days and I don't bother writing a review before giving them another chance.

I'm not giving Playt another chance. 

It was such a subpar experience that we left food uneaten (still paid the bill) and left within 30 mins of being seated. 

First, the service was a fail. We made advanced reservations for 5:30pm on a Saturday and when we arrived we weren't greeted for some time. The restaurant was nearly empty. Finally, made eye contact and a nice curly haired lady seated us. Took another several minutes before getting water. Another several minutes for our orders to be taken, etc. 

Mind you, the restaurant was almost empty. There was a male server who was prancing around, dancing, skipping us even when said curly haired lady gestured him to our table. He ignored us and danced around the host table while we were looking around for someone to take our order. 

Curly haired lady was the one who attended to us the whole time and I don't think she'a s server. +1 star for her. 

The food.....was.....terrible. I would have tolerated the service had the food not been so bad. OVERLOADED with salt in every dish. I like salty but this was unbearable. Overcooked shrimp, unripened tomatoes, bitter greens.....we literally tasted the 4 dished we ordered and then just stopped. 

We finished our drink, flagged down the busser who then flagged a server who then flagged down curly haired lady and we left after settling the bill. We were so annoyed with the whole experience (and hangry) that we didn't attempt to take up any issues with a manager and actually paid for the food we didn't eat...JUST TO LEAVE as fast as we could.

15 min later the couple that came in after us had a four course meal tables and we are still looking at soup. 2 min later the Lemon Chicken came out. Very well fried still crispy when the sauce was on it. The wonton soup and lemon chicken dat there for approximately 8 to 10 minutes before we noticed we had 1 cafeteria fork, no soy sauce or chili, no knife.

Strange thing. On our left was the couple next to us paying g for their meal with the manager apologizing g as to why their food came out so slow...all the weighted had been flying all around us all evening.

"I really really want to love this place but I can't. I've gone 3 times and each time I've loved the atmosphere but the food has not matched. The food is close to being good but it's needs more; more flavor, seasoning, etc. The dishes they serve are unique but really do lack flavor which is unfortunate because the menu would be so enticing if they could execute it correctly. 

- The brussle sprouts are in a marinade that don't quite work with the natural flavor of the vegetable. 
- The chicken sandwich is actually good (it's the only thing I recommend)
- The lamb burger sounds amazing but lacked so much flavor I was disappointed. 
- The mac and cheese was over priced for the size you get and again there was no flavor. 
- I'm forgetting the other dishes we got when we went all three times but that also shows none of them wowed us.

"Overall, ""okay"" food but overpriced. We came on what seemed like an off-time (early Sunday dinner). If I didn't have to pay for this meal I would probably rate it three stars. If looks were everything this place would be set- even the food ""looks"" good but it was very disappointing. I wanted to give 3 stars but after careful consideration, I had to bump it down to 2.

Positives
- Fast and friendly service
- good location downtown
- happy hour prices (m-f 3-6)

Negatives
- Food quality does not match menu prices
- Cold food
- mediocre flavors

Gouda Mac and Cheese Bites: decent flavor, but my first bite was cold. Not cooked long enough- no excuse for cold food in my opinion. The ranch that came with these was bomb.com - probably house made and very yummy. 5 stars for the ranch!!

Pretzels with Beer Cheese: The biggest disappointment. Tasted like frozen, reheated, barely warm pretzels and the ""cheese"" was really gloomy and thick and not that flavorful.

Gumbo Dinner: Felt like it was missing something, flavors didn't mesh well together. Sausage was a little spicy but overall very mild. My husband loves gumbo but he wasn't impressed.

Fried chicken dinner: Good size, 4 pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes, and ""salad"". Quotes around salad because it was a very sad pile of mixed greens with a brown dressing on the side. Not very appetizing looking. The mashed potatoes were a little off. I mean, how can you ruin mashed potatoes?? But I just didn't like them- very bland and not creamy. The fried chicken was okay, but Lucille's or maybe even (dare I say!) ... KFC is better. And way more pocket book friendly.

I feel like aesthetically they are going for hipster southern comfort, and if it were all about looks I would have liked this place. Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing. You know it's not that great when the best thing you ate was the ranch.

We may go back to try happy hour or a lunch sandwich- something a little less expensive and give them a second chance. This place always seems empty, I'm not sure how they're going to last.",2,2,3,2,0

Food: Our party had the beef wellington, their ""Cocotte"" chicken, and the coq au vin. We also tried several desserts

+ Molten lava cake: this was likely straight from Sysco.
+ Profiteroles: the accompanying vanilla ice cream tasted really bland, and the pastry portion was a bit soggy.

Service: Oddly rude throughout---needlessly condescending. For example, Cocotte's website explicitly says to park at a nearby store called ""The Jug Shop.""

I saw this on Instagram, it looked really good. I was hesitant about it at first and I should have trusted my instincts ... 

I made the mistake of coming here TWICE, and both experiences were terrible. 


First of all you have to walk up to a black gate and meet them to get your food... this seemed sketchy enough but it gets worse. 
There is CLEARLY no commercial kitchen here, it's food being cooked in someone's kitchen in their home. Judging by the character who gave me my food, their kitchen is probably disgusting. 
But still , I decided to support local business. 

I ordered an 8 wing combo , it was like $13, not a bad price, the side I chose was filthy rice. 

The rice was incredibly filthy, as I'm about half way through it, I find a hair that actually resembled a pube. 

So about a week or so after this first terrible experience , a friend suggests we get this. She too saw it on Instagram and convinced me to give it a second chance. I was pretty skeptic but gave in and decided to try again. 

Again I got an 8 wing combo, THE F*CKING CHICKEN WASN'T FULLY COOKED. 
I threw mine away, my friend who consumed hers got sick...
Never again.

Especially when her food prep guy deleted the order from their screen without actually making and serving the customer her order. 

*YOU SHOULD NOT charge your customers full price for a ""Super burrito"" when you have a sign that says (We do not have avocados. We apologize for the inconvenience). We know the extra $2.00 you charge for a super burrito is for the avocado. You should not tell customers, "" well there's guacamole salsa at the salsa bar"" when you're asked to please remove the avocado charge from the burrito, since you won't get any IN YOUR BURRITO. (She charged me full price anyway).

* If a customer asks for tacos with no onions, don't serve them plain and say "" I'm sorry I don't have cilantro. It's a Mexican restaurant. You have cilantro(5 seconds later a lady came from the kitchen with a plate full of diced cilantro).

"I think I was here about 15 years ago, don't really remember much about the food. Fog city diner I call it has been here for a long time, so hey let's try dinner. 

Maybe brunch is better or business lunch but dinner was pretty bland, boring, overpriced American food. 

Fried chicken was dry, batter was crunchy but just salty. 

Pizza could use better mozzarella that doesn't cool down to a lump. 

Crab Louie was tossed in lemon vinaigrette, never seen that. Was oily and why needed if 1000 was on side. I don't need oily greens, naked fresh as normal please. Crab was a pathetic amount, at $24 not worth it.

Oysters , $3 a pop? I guess that's minimum pricing now in sf. Oysters were the best.

Skirt steak was cooked well and tender nice.

All fries a bit hard and not piping hot.

Mac cheese not enough cream, cheese, more cheese for salt. 

Large cube for scotch, plus.

Grew up in sf, travel a lot for work in USA. So many great cities with food much better value and better choices than sf unfortunately. Oh you're from sf, there's so much good food, uh not really. Try Dallas, Lincoln, Chicago, Ann Arbor ...

"Went to ASA tonight at 5:15, no reservation. 

Requested table for 2. Receptionist told us they had no room, could not accommodate walk in's unless could be out by 6:30. 

She then seated us at a high top table adjacent to the bar which was fine. After this less than positive start we got seated. Menu arrived...several entrees $30+. 

Menu cost, combined with our experience at the door, we left and went to Dry Creek Grill.

The first time I came my family waited for about 40 minutes and were wondering why it was taking so long because there were so many empty tables and no one being seated. We just left, as well as other families, because the wait was too long. My dad and I decided to try again for the second time. It wasn't that crowded but there were still empty tables and about one party ahead of us. The waitlist was on a small chair and a young child was scribbling on it. I don't know whose fault it was but the child's parents just laughed at their kid and didn't even tell her to stop because other parties needed to sign it. The lady who worked there didn't do anything. When we came inside the worker looked at us, but did not greet us or even told us about the wait. We sat down and waited until another party of two came in and a worker came to them and gave them the waitlist to sign first instead of us. Again, we just left.

The building where it is located is a nice Victorian and was promising as we walked in. The evening we were there it looked like there was only 1 waiter or so it seemed since he was pretty rushed.

It was very loud and the food was just meh. The warm goat salad was OK and was drenched in dressing. The Turkey soup was all right. The salmon was very disappointing and was not fresh. The rib eye with mashed potatoes was just OK and so was the flourless cake. Was disappointed in the quality of the food, definitely not worth the price.",2,2,3,2,0

"Of the boiled seafood restaurants I've been to (bibs and everything) I've never been to one so poorly run. Complaint has little to do with the staff--they were kind and accommodating, cheers to them.

First: no proper utensils! Everything is plastic or paper EXCEPT for the one pair of scissors supplied that supposedly should replace your regular seafood crackers. Plastic fork to dig out of the shell rather than your regular seafood pick. The scissors stab through openings of the shell, so someone can easily stab themselves especially with saucy gloves on. 

Second: upon removing a crab leg, there was a hair on it.... I'm not really sure how much more to elaborate on my disgust. Yes, a stray hair is bound to find it's way in lots of places. But in a fresh bag of sauced up crab legs? 

Won't be coming back for sure. Take your chances, food was good. Loved the Rockin combo, but poor management to have a restaurant not only super wasteful, but to be so cheap as to not have proper utensils. The stray hair was just the cherry on top.",1,0,1,0,0

My gf and I, ordered a 30 piece meal for our family after a long day. The cashier explained that it would take 25 mins for our meal to be ready, which is understandable. 10 minutes go by and my gf and I notice that there is an order ready that was place on the ready rack, however no name or number was called. So we assumed it couldn't be our order because they didn't say our name. 25 minutes go by and we notice that the six employees that were present at the time were loud and goofing off with one another. Not being crowded at all and waiting for awhile, I finally ask someone where our order was because it has been 30 mins. Low and behold the order that was placed on the ready rack 20 minutes ago, was our order. They lied to us and stated that they called our name, when in reality my gf and I were sitting on the bench in the front by the cashier the whole time.

My son and I went out to dinner here tonight and the chow fun my son ordered didn't taste good. We told the waiter and he brought over whom we were told to be the manager. We explained that the Chow Fun tasted bad and we wanted to exchange it for a different item. In over 4 decades of going to restaurants, I've only had to return an item twice before that I can recall. And both times those restaurants handled the situation gracefully. Here, the manager refused to credit us for the bad dish. Then, with no real warning or better reason, after 10 minutes of arguing, he changed his mind and told us that he would credit us for the bad food. 

Problem solved, right? 

Wrong. 

The person we had been told was the manager returned to say that HIS boss told him to tell us that they are revoking their decision and only crediting us 50% off the price of the $12 bad dish. Very bad customer service and management decisions. We've been getting take out from this place for years. 

Now, we will never set foot in this place again (but at least they got their extra $6 for their Chow Fun)

"This review is not based on the food, but rather the service my friend, his son and I received at this restaurant. 

We walked in on a Saturday evening and were not greeted. The host looked at us and asked, ""can I help you?"" Usually, when people enter a restaurant, they are looking to eat there, but the way the question was phrased made us feel uncomfortable, as if we were usurpers in his establishment. 

Since the table we were seated at was very close to the front door and another group of guests and there was a seemingly available table in an adjacent room visible through an open curtain-draped doorway, we asked if we could be seated there. We had a small child with us and also wanted to sit a little further away from the other guests in case he made noise. 

The host looked at us and said that the other room was closed. He then asked, ""so, what's wrong with this table? Why can't you sit there?"" He didn't ask in a joking and friendly way, but in a tone suggesting he was confused and/or insulted by our question. Usually, when guests ask for another table, the host tries to be accommodating. This was not the case. 

We sat down with our menus and were ignored for several minutes. My friend put his son on his lap, and like most babies, he wanted to explore his surroundings, and so he began touching the curtain next to our table. He wasn't grabbing or chewing or spitting on the curtain---just rubbing his hands across it. Apparently this was enough to unnerve the host, who took the opportunity to reprimand us in front of the other guests, telling us that my friend's son's behavior was ""unacceptable!"" After that, we got up and left.

I understand that certain restaurants are more kid-friendly than others, but we did not intend to be a nuisance and there was really no need to treat paying customers in that manner.

"Food here is generally decent but today I had a different experience with the service. I ordered a ""skinny"" margarita because I wanted the fresh squeezed lime and orange juice and described on the menu. 
When it comes back, I get a drink filled w triple sec. I had two other people taste it and they both agreed. So I politely tell the waitress that the drink has triple sec. she disagreed with me and asked if I wanted order a different drink and was annoyed. The way she said it made me feel uncomfortable like I was being a problem. Later as I kept drinking it, I realized I was paying an additional $5 for the fresh lime juice so I decided to walk to the bar to ask if they could just re make it without triple sec. I was rudely stopped by 3 people ( including the waitress) and felt ganged up on. The man told me I had to sit down and re order a drink in a stern voice, like I was a child. He also told me that is how they make the ""skinny"" drink, to order a different drink then because that's how they make it. I was in shock. I went back to my table and re read the menu and it clearly says fresh lime juice and orange. 
I don't understand why they just wouldn't make it as advertised? I know they have lime, and orange juice? So now I'm here, waiting for my water after I got my food and others received refills, I don't think I will ever get as the service gets worse. No thank you.",2,0,0,0,0

Which is fine if they want to close early, but she gave us so much attitude for the entire time we were there. She acted like she was annoyed to be taking our orders the entire time, and she snapped at my friend that they ran out of carnitas. 

While we were waiting for our tacos, I asked her if getting pickled jalepenos were extra, and she just rolled her eyes and said yes they're extra and walked away before I could even say I wanted to buy some. 

We asked the other staff if we could sit on the outside tables, and we were told that it's fine. However later when we went back inside to get some water, she snapped ""if you guys are going to eat outside make sure none of that trash comes back inside"". Yikes.

"Convenience and a view. If you're in the area, sure, it's a good place to watch the water. The food though, is mostly mediocre. Calamari was the most egregious. $22+ for oily, over-cooked pieces, some of which still had the clear shell/skin (see picture). 

Clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl was fine, fettuccine Alfredo with crab was good (needed salt), but was the size of my fist (for $29.99, I expect to be full). Kids battered and deep fried chicken breast and potatoes were boring. 

Bread with butter for the table was nice. 

Service.... was really disappointing. Food came out really fast, but only one followup. Waited more than 15 minutes to ask for ketchup (just couldn't find our server) although it did come quickly once we made the request. Overall, it felt like our severs were busy talking to each other and not looking over instead of keeping an eye on their tables. There was another table where the customer had to get out of their seat to make a request for bread, also after waiting a while. The speed with which they get you the check is impressive. 

Overall, it was a less than satisfying meal and less than satisfying experience although there was nothing specific I could pinpoint that ""ruined it."" Calamari shell was discovered after we got the check and we weren't going to eat any more anyway, so we didn't bother to point it out to the server.

First off, my to-go order took 40 minutes to get to me. 30 minutes into waiting, I finally asked if someone could check up on my food. Even though I was cleary sitting there waiting for my food no one ever bothered to ask me anything about why I was waiting.

The lady comes back 5 minutes later and apologized saying that my order for some reason was not put in. She said it was a computer glitch and that she'd get my food and give me a refund (but she never did).

She then came back with the food and says ""oh someone gave you the wrong number that's why you never got the sandwich and then walked away as if her promise for a refund no longer mattered because it was not the computer's fault. Someone still gave me the wrong number and she never bothered to ask me about my order even though I was sitting there for 40 minutes and I saw her asking all these other folks about an order and she was just ignoring me the whole time.

As for the food, it was sub-par. I ordered the garlic chicken pesto sandwich and it was too salty and looked and tasted fake. I am so disappointed with this place and the fact that I spent over $14 plus tip (that they didn't even deserve but the cashier looked at me while I was on the tip page, which is unprofessional).

"Mmmm, yeah no. 

This place just wasn't good value for my money. That's not to say their ramen was ""bad,"" because it was ""OK."" 
Bullet points:

-Nice center table, but completely unnecessary. It eats into the number of tables they can really put in here. Poor utilization of their already small floor space. Form over function. 

-Pricing was on the expensive side considering the quantity of food received. $14 for base ramen? Want egg? They charge you for it. Corn? They charge you for that too. Nori? You guessed it -they charge for that too. A bowl of ramen can be had for the $15 and below range with all of the above things elsewhere. I don't have positive feelings about this nickle and diming of the customer. 
$80 for five bowls of ramen where 4/5 of the bowls had no toppings? Steep. 

-""Options."" While I feel options are nice in most instances, they go overboard here a little bit. Too many options is a bad thing too. I'm not even sure people know what options they want. 99% of people just want a solid bowl of ramen. People don't need 4 levels of saltiness. People don't need 5 levels of spicy-ness. People don't need 4 levels of noodle firmness. 

-Two menus? One based on each of the base broths offered? Painfully unnecessary and confusing for the customer especially since they look identical. The menus are also super beta ... I mean they are printed on standard paper stock? And half the options were crossed off or unavailable. So much for those options. 

-The ramen wasn't the conventional wide noodle one might expect. The noodles were more egg-noodle like. Nah, hard pass. 

-The stars are for ramen (and by this I mean the broth) that is a really just ""OK"" in my opinion. Staff is friendly and attentive and the facility is very clean. 

Other than that though ...

It was a very warm night, so I thought I'd get the Fiesta Tostada, since a salad would be healthy and light which, I was told was the same as the Roques Tostada, only coming in a shell, and was told the Roques Tostada came with more guacamole. I got the beef option. I also got a glass of Sangria. 

The Tostada had extremely minimal lettuce. The lettuce was shredded, as if on the smallest shred size, as when you buy or grate the tiniest-sized shredded cheese. I'd have a few tiny strands of lettuce in my first bites, and none for the last half. Almost the entire salad was a ground beef sauce, with a dollop of sour cream on one side, and a dollop of guacamole on the other. That was it. No salad. The plate had some refried beans on it with melted cheese on top, and a little rice, so that was mainly my meal--refried beans and rice. That was $18! My drink was around $9, and my friend's drink, a margarita, was around $13, so since we split our bill (our entrees were the same price), I payed over $31 for basically rice and beans & a so-so sangria. 

I would not eat here again. I certainly would never order the tostadas! The meal I had was possibly worth around $7.50, if you liked the pile of ground meat sauce.",1,1,0,0,0
"We have been dining in and ordering togo for a long time but the last couple times that we ordered wasn't good, not sure they changed the ownership or chef. Tofu soup had no flavor while we ordered medium, the taste was like water, spicy rice cake's spiciness level always change. When we ordered mild, they didn't add any spice sauce (rice cake was almost 100% white) but add so much black pepper. When we ordered medium, it was way too spicy from sauce+black pepper. When we didn't specify, we got the right level but keep changing level like no standard. 

We don't mind the prices but it wasn't worth for the price we paid in the past couple times. We might try one more time and if it is still not hit what it used to be, then we will stop going there. There are many Tofu House around.",2,0,1,0,0

"I have been coming here since its opening, and the service has worsened over time. I've given this place so many chances and tolerated so many things but tonight (evening on a weekend) just pushed me to my limits. I am no longer this location's advocate because my friends and other family/friends were proven right: the service at this location needs analysis and improvement (to put it kindly).

- When they sat us (party of 5) down at our table, the containers for garnishes were nearly empty (as expected. Ive always had to ask for refills here). 
- Took ~15-20mins for someone to acknowledge us; thus, took a while for someone to take our order. This time, they didn't ask if we've been here before and one of the members of our party had no idea on how to order.
- My friend doesn't know how to use chopsticks and had to ask three waiters/waitresses for a fork. Her food was already out and it took another 15mins of waiting until her fork arrived.
- But, we couldn't start eating anyhow because two of our party members didn't have their food (combo meat slices and chicken karaage bowl)! After waiting 15-20 MORE minutes (and yes, at this point, Im so embarrassed I suggested we eat here!), the food finally arrives out with a silent waiter. No apologies. 

They knew they did wrong because another waiter (probably the manager?) came to us later and apologized for the wait on the chicken because ""there's a mix-up on the tickets"". At least he communicated with us; thats commendable. Communication should be emulated by all service personnel of this establishment.

In the end, they messed up on our bill (with no surprise). 

Suggested Areas of Improvement:
- Ensure garnishes are replenished for new parties BEFORE they're seated
- Confirm new visitors 
- Acknowledge new tables
- When food comes out, communicate with table whether all food is out and everything is okay!! 
- Continue being aware of the soup levels (good job with this)",1,1,3,1,0

Tell your doctor to test you - your are going to pay for it in the long run tell them you may need to sue press the issue I can't tell you guys enough because they don't care about you at all and it's just a job to them PERIOD

"I started coming here out of frustration with El Burrito Express on Taraval (long lines/waits/often cannot reach by phone to place order in advance/phone orders still mean you must wait in the long line to pay and pick up) and realized the food was pretty good. 

The food is simple and good, but I am unhappy over the fact that when I, a woman, order a burrito, I watch them put about 60% rice, 20% bean, and 10-15% meat. I've watched them prepare burritos for men big and small, and they are given significantly more meat. Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I'm not hungry, shouldn't get the same amount of food, or am incapable of eating the same amount as men. Next time I'm there I will mention it and depending on their reaction I may or may not give them my business again.

"I was sick and in desperate need for some hot soup. I called in my order and was asked to wait, ""Sure"", I said not concerned to wait my turn.

I waited for 5 minutes while listening to the cashier take the order of a lady who could not make up her mind. After the woman's order had been taken I waited... I began to worry she had forgotten about me. But I needed soup, and BAD! Finally she picked up the phone and apologized profusely for the wait. ""No worries."" I responded; all I wanted was soup for I knew it cure my cold!

Sure, my nose was slightly plugged but to me the black garlic soup was bland. The meat wasn't as fresh as I prefer; it had that slightly old meat flavor you get after you reheat it a few days later for an afternoon snack.

"Wow. Not really sure where to start but.. we only went to this place because Southern Comfort (our original choice) was busy with a line out the door.

Serving, taking orders, taking money, etc.. we get seated rather promptly, handed menus and water. Let me break down the order...

Wor Wonton Soup - 1 star - This ""soup"" was so bland that all the soy sauce I doused it with didnt help. The actual wontons were flavorless. The broth was so incredibly clear that I originally thought it was water.

Salt and Pepper Tofu - 3 stars - It was just ok, nothing bad, but nothing great.

Honey Walnut Shrimp - 1 star - It had such a horrible fishy taste that I truly took my paper napkin and spit it out. It was that bad. It tasted like the smell of rotten fish, if you can imagine that. The dish came with 9 prawns. 

Some type of fish fried rice - 3 stars - I cant remember what it was called, but it was edible enough for me to eat some of it.

I had been here once before, thought I would give them another try. Never again.

"Came here back in July when it recently opened. I saw people raving about the place, so I went to check it out. Came during lunchtime, so it was packed. No one came to help me or even acknowledge my presence at the front. Two older ladies made eye contact, but ignored me. I wrote my name on the waiting list, but after about 10 minutes, I decided to walk into the restaurant up to one of the ladies. She seemed bewildered and annoyed at me, but pointed to an empty table. I did notice that table was empty ever since I came. I thought it was strange that she did not even bother to check the waiting list. I felt pretty guilty since I saw multiple 1-2 persons on the waiting list before me, I think they were standing outside, but I needed to get lunch and move on.

The lady handed me the menu and and immediately asked me for my order. I clearly did not even look at the menu! I asked for some time to look at the menu and she impatiently stood beside me and asked for my order again within a minute. Thank goodness I knew the rave was about the kalbijjim, so I just went ahead and asked about smaller portions for kalbijjim. She said they don't do that, impatiently flipped the menu, pointed, and told me to get the beef rib soup. I just said okay because I didn't want to deal with her staring me down when it has only been 2-3 minutes! I kept the menu to look at other options while I was waiting for my food.

Banchan came out quickly, but they were not good. Beef rib soup came out shortly after. Honestly, a huge waste of money. It was expensive, but not worth the price at all. The soup clearly did not have good stock. The scent and taste of meat in the broth was extremely weak. The broth was salty with the taste of iodized salt. The meat was tough.

I realize I should be here for the kalbijjim as it is what it is known for. However, the lady said the beef rib soup was a popular choice, so I should expect something decent from the so claimed ""popularity"" and that expensive price!

A part of my inspiration for trying to broaden my culinary horizons a little (and getting back into Yelping) was seeing and hearing about some of the places she goes to.

The inside looks a bit fancier than any Indian restaurant I've been to in recent memory. Not quite ""fine dining"" level, but just about there. The restaurant was also relatively empty, since we went around the late lunch/early dinner hour on a Sunday, so I figured the service had a chance to be a big hit, but was probably going to be a big miss.

This was one of those times where I really hated to be right about these sorts of things.

To be fair, I know Indian food takes longer to prepare than most if you want it done right, and I do. I think similar to my visits to Biryani Stop back home, the emptiness of the restaurant made the delay seem longer than it actually was, but even factoring that in it still felt long.

As for what we got for food, my friend knew I was taking notes for a review (and I was buying anyway,) so we went all out. I had never seen cheese pakora on the menu at any Indian place I'd been to and it seemed interesting, so we went with that and samosas (something we both like) for our appetizers. We both had chicken tikka masala for our entree, and while my friend had garlic naan, I went with the keema (lamb mince) naan, yet another option I hadn't seen elsewhere. Kheer was our dessert of the day to round everything out.

As a concept, the cheese pakora seemed like a winner - basically like cheese sticks, but in ball form and more baked in a pastry rather than breaded and fried, that you can dip in chutney. The tamarind chutney was also really, really good. What wasn't good was the execution of this dish - the pastry was a bit too flaky, so a couple of the balls were pretty much falling apart. One didn't even have any cheese. So while I liked it, it was still a bit disappointing. The samosas at least were okay.

The inconsistency carried over to the keema naan, which had some pieces that were underbaked, some that were overbaked, and all kinda falling apart a bit too much for my liking. The overbaked pieces were honestly a bit better, since they seemed to fall apart less. Again, I liked the taste, but I just couldn't quite get past the appearance without noticing the flaws. My friend's garlic naan was at least cooked right as far as either of us could tell, though neither of us really enjoyed it a whole lot. Not bad, but not really great either.

The chicken tikka masala was very noteworthy to me for being some of the biggest pieces of chicken I've ever seen in the dish. It's the first time either me or my friend could remember needing a knife for chicken tikka masala. This didn't really detract from the taste, which was definitely the high point for us, but it was definitely a point of curiosity.

Sadly, we didn't end on that note, as the kheer got mixed reactions from us. I loved it, but my friend thought it was too sweet. Her theory (which I agree with) was that they used condensed milk in the recipe, which she hasn't come across in other places she's ordered kheer from.

I don't know whether we just came in at exactly the wrong time or it was just a bad day, but I can't help but think this wasn't a typical day here. Even so, with so many other options (including at least one other Indian restaurant) within walking distance, inconsistency can be the difference between gaining and losing a customer. It didn't bother me much because great company makes even the worst experience a lot easier to deal with, but it would have been boring and unsatisfying if I were by myself.

Maybe next time.",2,1,3,2,0

It's supposed to be family style but portions are on the small end for family style. Also price seems a bit high for the quality of the food.

"Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be so much better but now... I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

The place used to be authentic with flavorful offerings and despite its modest looks, it used to deliver on what mattered. Not anymore. 

Where do I start? The starters were so bland and tasteless. They looked meh, too. After a few bites, despite being hungry, I couldn't even get myself to eat more. These have to be amongst the worst if not the worst shredded potatoes I've ever tasted. They didn't look right either. The garlic eggplant smelled funky. Took a bite and wanted to throw up. There was definitely something off. Again, I was hungry, I love eggplant with garlic but I couldn't get myself to eat more than a bite.

Finally, the saving grace - the dumplings! Nope. Here, you can see the chefs making the dumplings in front of you. That's one of the things that make this place feel a bit more homey and special. Except... they were stone cold. I don't mean kind'a cold. They were cold, cold.

Lastly, the only thing that was and still is great - the Beef Huoshao! Nice, flaky, puffy and absolutely delicious. Alas, this alone likely won't make me come back. 

So sad considering this place was a bit special. Now, I can't advise anyone to get anything beyond the Beef Huoshao.",2,1,3,2,0

Then I tasted it. Absolutely no flavor whatsoever! I added a little very thin,teriyaki sauce to part of it and some jellied BBQ sauce to another part. Still very little flavor. It was almost as if the pork roast was simmered in boiling water with no flavoring at all and it was so very finely shredded. It isn`t at all hard to prepare, just takes time to slow cook. It did not have a hint of smoke flavor and certainly not roasted to a flavorful finish. The macaroni salad was good.",1,0,0,0,0

The total is 12.55, and I got 54 cents in coins, so I asked if I could pay with 54 cents to avoid more coins in the returning change. The waitresses shouted at me "" What ? No! Of course! How can I get less ?! "" 

I don't know how to describe my feelings at that moment. What I tipped here was much more than 1 cent, but what I got today was a shout on 1 cent!

At first, we were one of three tables being served, since it was an early time for dinner. When we left, the place was filled, and several takeout orders were made.

The food, to out tastes, was terrible. The garlic chicken had bland, pale, pounded pieces of protein floating on a bed of large pieces of fresh celery. The celery was great, but that is not a compliment for a dish called garlic chicken. The pea greens were cooked well, tasty, but a little tough. The beef noodles were ok, but nothing special. These three dishes were specifically, not hot selections. The veggies were not overcooked and were fresh. The last dish was a specialty to even be on the menu, fire charred pork kidneys. I didn't see any blackened meat, but it was swimming in chili oil, not too hot as described, but cooked and served in oil. Not very appetizing, but then the same could be said by most people about any kind of kidneys.

Maybe we should have ordered something different like their Black Garlic oil ramen. I felt their ramen was not the traditional Japanese ramen because it had cabbage and rehydrated Wakame seaweed instead green onion and nori seaweed.

"Not what it was or just an outlier experience?

We've been big fans of Ajanta in the past.

On more than one occasion we have received food to the table without utensils being brought out to the table first.

Today especially was horrible. First we were told that reservations are needed to dine because most people reserve tables although there obviously plenty of empty tables. What restaurant doesn't welcome walk-up patrons when they do not have a full house?

Secondly, as we are ordering sodas we are told there are no carbonated drinks because the machine is down and all they have is orange juice but after asking more questions we found out they also had lemonade. We said we would stick to water and while we were waiting on our food I walked to a nearby restaurant and purchased carbonated drinks to accompany my meal. The host rudely said we do not allow outside drinks and walked off, meanwhile there was another patron that had a bottle of coke.

We asked 3 times for the status of the Mac and cheese side and it didn't come until the meal was done. The staff seems stuck up and uncaring for patrons to have a good experience.

"I love this place, but they are false advertisers or they have not properly educated their staff. I don't want to believe they are intentionally misleading diners but that may be the case. Three colleagues and I ate here this afternoon. One ordered the beet burger, another ordered the grass fed burger and two of us ordered the sea bass.

The food arrived and the fish was CLEARLY not sea bass. I assumed it was halibut and when I asked the waitstaff they insisted that it was sea bass ""that's DEFINITELY sea bass."" I know my fish. I said sea bass is flaky, somewhat translucent, the fish I had was not sea bass. After ping pong discussion they finally asked if I wanted them to check with the chef. Of course I did. 

They did and surprise! The chef says it's definitely BASS, it's from 'Africa.' Okay, the whole continent? Whatever. Then I say again it might be bass but it's not sea bass. She says they chef insists that it's striped bass."" I tell her that striped bass is NOT sea bass. She says ""well does it at least taste good?"" I say yes but as you can see it's not what I expected. I suggested she inform the manager to change the menu to accurately reflect what they are selling. She never called the manager over never even acknowledged that she would. She says something about how I was right and that's a good idea then walks away. I decide not to make a big deal of it and continue with our late lunch since I'm trying to catch up with colleagues. 

True food charges $32 for a striped bass entree that is deceivingly named on the menu and receipt sea bass.

"It was my first time there and likely my last. The reason I'm giving it a 2/5 is all based on the food. In order to be fair one should compare them with their competitors in the neighborhood. We've got Dish&Dash(their fast food store), falafel stop and Sajj which offer similar food with almost same pricing. If I want to rank them here is my opinion: 1. Falafel Stop 2. Dish&Dash 3. Sajj 4. Halal Guys

The main reason for my ranking is the taste and side options. The food is so bland. The plates are so simple. The side/toppings that they offer is way less than other places. Hummus and Baba Ganush is extra and they only offer jalape�����o, olives, onions and green pepper as toppings. The dish itself comes with lettuce, tomato and rice. The meat is also not well seasoned. They top everything with a mayo based sauce which is so NOT Mediterranean. At least add some popular yogurt based Mediterranean sauce!

The food tasted fine but the eggs were cold, and at that point it seemed impossible to get someone's attention in a reasonable amount of time.

"I really wanted to like this place. There are so few good restaurants in Belmont, compared to San Mateo and Redwood City. Unfortunately, it was expensive and disappointing. Not even as good as plain home cooked food by Peruvians I have known. 

We shared three appetizers--grilled beef appetizer, ceviche, and a kale salad-- plus a side of plantain fries to try as many things as possible. The timing of the food was fine, as was the service and the drinks, but we had someone checking on us every five minutes, which really got to be quite annoying and had a feel of desperation!

The first dish, grilled beef, did not taste grilled and wasn't hot. It was warm and chewy with a smooth texture, almost as if it had just been dehydrated a little. I ate some of it but couldn't finish, it grossed me out too much. My boyfriend didn't really like it but finished it with the sauce they gave us. It also came with a pile of hominy (?) Not sure what the point of that was but they were hard and almost tasteless.

Next up was the ceviche which didn't come with anything to eat it with. When I asked about chips, there was some awkward exchange with the waiter about how they don't serve it with and apparently don't have chips. Ceviche can be okay by itself, if it's mixed with tomatoes or mango, but this one came off too fishy and this time the rough texture of the fish turned me off.

I'm really not a picky eater so for me to have that experience twice in one meal was a bummer. The kale and quinoa salad was pretty good and we enjoyed that the most though it's probably the least Peruvian. When the fries came, I wondered why there were only about 6 (large like steak fries). As soon as I tried one I knew why. They were thick and dry and starchy, really not good at all. Why even make fries out of plantains when they come out like this? We drowned them in sauce to get them down and had to eat them or would have still been hungry.

At the end of it, we spent $90 for a weekday dinner for two (including a beer and a glass of wine). I was still trying to talk myself into giving it another try when the next day, our lunch was catered by a Peruvian place in the city. It was so delicious and included real grilled beef, and delicious plantains the way I've always loved them!

"Great food but terrible service. So disappointed with the behavior the staff members. My friend I went there on Friday around 5:30pm. There were hardly 2 more customers there, the place was pretty empty. My friend and I ordered food and since we had met after a long time, requested one of the staff lady to take our photo. 

She seemed busy and asked another old staff member(there were three people and she was the oldest people out of them) to take the photo of us. That woman was a horror show. She snatched the phone from my friend and literally rolled her eyes and took photo(she literally took everything in the frame except for us) and almost scoffed at us when we said thank you. Later we called her three times to bring us our cheque but she looked and walked away totally ignoring us. Then another guy came around who was very polite and was happy to help us. I'm usually not so sensitive about all these things but there came another family who looked from Thailand as they spoke the same language as this lady, she happily went to them and took their order, laughed with them took their photos as well. 

This was the most disrespectful behavior I have ever received and I am definitely never going back to this place. 

No doubt the food is good and they present their food pretty well too but just food cannot make up for the bad behavior of the staff members, its such a bad experience.

I want to write about the food but I would highly recommend to just take-out their food and avoid yourself the displeasure of the staff members.",1,1,5,0,0

We ordered a couple wet burritos to go. For the meat they were out of al pastor which is what I wanted so my wife ordered me carnitas instead with sour cream and fresh avocado. She had chile verde pork. The carnitas was bland, overly dry, and super salty. The chile verde was super salty. The rice was mushy. My burrito didn't have avocado or sour cream, which we didn't get charged for either, but it seems it was left off the order. That's either very inattentive on a simple order, or they don't do add ons to a regular burrito but just chose to ignore the request entirely without saying anything.

I ate 3 bites, couldn't continue, so I threw the rest away and drove over to Super Duper Burger.

"It is such a shame that we're only able to enjoy this *beautiful* city waterfront spot by enduring the truly, unbelievably bad service Lake Chalet provides - I'm surprised and disappointed that the city of Oakland chose a business with what appears to be actual disdain for its fellow Oakland residents to operate here. 

I've been here about 5 times for work events, happy hours, etc. and most recently for brunch on a sunny weekend day. Each time, coordinating with the host or hostess has been an almost comical challenge - (very) long unexplained waits, lost reservations, incorrect seatings, and more, with communication that ranges from nonexistent to dismissive to objectively rude. 

If it wasn't for the absolutely looooovely setting I wouldn't have come back after the first time, and after the fifth bad experience, I'm finally there. 

If you're thinking of going, go for drinks only and suspend any expectations of even basic interpersonal skills from staff and management (and enjoy the view!).

"The crab sandwich was made with not too much mayonnaise giving it a fresh healthy taste. A little bland. The croissant was toasted and had a nice crunch to it. 

The calamari steak sandwich was good. Same croissant. My gf had no complaints. She did not like the shrimp salad though, said it tasted too ""sea foody"".

The clam chowder was alright. I thought it was comparable to Progresso, but with less clam. My gf thought it was better than canned. Agree to disagree.

We got the sandwich and soup combo #5 and #7. This is where they really lost points. The server, the male Latino one, was extremely nice. He brought us out our soups and a shrimp salad. It was our first time here we didn't know the shrimp salad didn't come with it. As the sandwiches came out, the lady told us the shrimp didn't come with it. She asked us to pay $10, albeit it was very polite. I told her I didn't have enough cash and my gf didn't have her cash on her at all. She then told me that we can go to grocery outlet, buy something, and get cash back. As we looked on the menu, she came back and said she would give us a discount and only charge us $5. 

So I went to grocery outlet, bought something, got cash back, gave the woman $5 for the mistake they made finished our food and left. We both considered just not paying, taking our food, leaving the shrimp, and bouncin.

Taste - Really bad. I've gotten some version of this soup at so many restaurants and it's always good, except for here. My coworker took one bite and couldn't eat any more. He described it as way too greasy and said that it looked like it was just water with oil in it. I couldn't even get that far, the smell was too bad.

"I'm so conflicted in writing this review because long story short-- the food was great, the service was horrendous.

We visited on a Saturday and were impressed with the variety on the menu. They had some healthy veggie/grain bowls for our health-conscious dining guest, but they also offered a vast array of cuisines, from mexican, to burgers, to pizza, and more.

I landed on the wipeout Nachos as my meal and they were amazing. They were just what I was craving on a sunny day that felt like a vacation. The pricing was fair and the portion for my nachos was huge. 

Despite all the good with the food itself, our server, Kap, was horrendous. As we were ordering drinks, he didn't even look at me. He took the order of my two male dining partners and seemed like he was about to leave without taking my order. He seemed a little disoriented when I spoke up-- did he not even see me there? When he finally brought our drinks out, he mixed up our drinks and didn't remember to bring one of them. He needed a reminder of which drink he was missing. He neglected to bring us silverware or napkins. He didn't offer refills. We had to flag him down for refills and seemed confused when we asked. We had been done with our meals for several minutes and he didn't bring out our check. We had to flag him down again. He walked by our table multiple times without grabbing our payments, until we finally had to basically force them into his hand as he was walking by. At this point, we were very annoyed that we had spent more than half the time at the restaurant waiting to pay, but it didn't stop there. After taking our payments, he disappeared. It was at least ten minutes before he returned with our credit cards and receipts. He was nowhere to be found, even when we got up and tried to find him. He never once apologized for our wait. He never once asked if he could get us anything or checked in on how our meals were.

I don't know if he was having an off day or had been given too many tables, but I've never had that terrible of service anywhere.

Came by today to grab Tteokbokki (Rice Cake, Cheese, Onions, Noodles, Fish Cakes). The $15 almost $16 plate was definitely a disappointment. 

- Tteokbokki : only contained 3 thin slices of fish cakes, about 5 pieces of rice cake, and a little cheese.

"I'm actually so sad right now eating my bowl of ""laksa"". The laksa tastes nothing like real laksa. The soup is watery and is more of a tomyum flavour. I feel like at its base laksa soup is the most basic part of it whether you're making curry laksa or penang laksa. It's really not that hard to make a laksa broth, there are even instant noodles laksa flavoured that taste more real than this broth. The laksa doesn't even have fish cake or fish balls or bean curd puff like wtf is this. Instead they add radish and carrot like ?????????? It also costs 2$ extra to add egg, but the egg is a ramen egg not a hard boiled egg like you're supposed to have in laksa. 

Honestly it feels like cultural appropriation to claim to make Malaysian food when it's more of a fusion and because it feels like there wasnt even an effort made to research the dish and recreate the taste. If you're not authentic that's fine, but just state that you're fusion so you dont get people's hopes up.

I also ordered a coconut and ask them to pour it into a cup for me and the amt of coconut juice was miniscule. Honestly not their fault directly, but the coconut costs 5.25 and if thats the amt of water thats inside yall should change your suppliers because you're getting some dry ass coconuts.",2,1,2,0,0
"Maybe we ate too much at lunch or we came on an off-night. We'd hoped for more but alas, while service was decent, the food could have been better.

We were greeted and seated, menus presented, water poured, and pita quarters dipping oil presented. Our table was two two-tops pushed together next to the window. Our dining companion was seated at a bench while we sat in two chairs. It may have been a tad more convenient to have seated us at the four-top directly to the left of our table but I'm guessing they wanted to seat the windows first.

Two of us stayed with ice water while one of us ordered Morocco Mint Green Tea. The drink prices seem a bit odd to me. They are listed under the Sides, such as Greek French Fries and Saut�����ed Mixed Vegetables. The six side vegetables are $3, $4 & $5 each while Soft Drinks, Lemonade and Coffees are $4 each. Turkish Coffee goes for $5.

We went skipped appetizers and went straight to entrees.

My Bouillabaisse was okay. The salmon, clams, mussels were cooked perwas the single sea scallop (menu says scallops) The prawns were overcooked. I would have enjoyed a bit more Garlic Bruschetta to soak up the Sauce as I only got two very thin slices.

Her Sultan's Favorite had tender lamb but everything else reminded her of a ""1950's casserole"". Edible but certainly not to be ordered again. And while a copy of the menu on Yelp says that the dish is served with a House Salad, one was not presented nor offered.

We don't know how our friends Kofte Kobap was. She finished everything but a portion of the rice so maybe it was okay?

"Not the best representation of this chain. 

I'm generally not picky on service and I'm actually a fan of the monstrous menus at this chain restaurant, but my first (and maybe last) experience at this particular location left a lot to be desired. 

The wait for two on a Sunday morning around lunchtime was actually great! We waited about 15 minutes before being seated outside. The outdoor area at this location was beautiful! They had a nice place to lounge while you waited and there were heating elements on as there was a chilly breeze the morning I went. You could also see they had fans available for hotter days. 

The unpleasantness began once we got seated. We had waters dropped off and promptly ordered our food since we'd had time to look at the menu while waiting and figured the rest of our experience would be as good as our first impression! 

However... 30 min later, we hadn't had bread brought to our table although a larger party seated near us had already had 3 bread trays served to them. A couple next to us who had gotten seated shortly after we had had already asked for bread on their behalf and ours more than once, but nothing. Our food finally arrived around 40 minutes after ordering, and we were halfway through eating it when a half-filled bread basket was dropped off. They brought the other half of the bread a little later. The timing wasn't really appropriate. We'd also noticed the larger party got their food before us despite ordering afterward (they got seated approximately 10 minutes after us and were perusing their menus while we were ordering).

My tacos (3.5/5) were good, but the chicken and waffles benedict were rather small and overpriced. 2/5.

We'd spent so long waiting for our food we kind of just wanted to get out of there, but it would be another 20-25 minutes before they came back to our table to bring us our bill. 

The waitstaff was nice, but likely overworked. No one likes to show up at a restaurant and be ignored in favor of larger parties. They may have won over their business, but they've lost ours (and probably that of the pleasant couple we complained with over our brunch). I'll come back to Cheesecake Factory... but not the one in Walnut Creek.",2,2,6,3,0

When we asked questions to the cashier, she sort of grunted her answers, which we weren't sure if we should take as yes or no.

The rice, chicken and shrimp was good and as expected. The macaroni salad was weirdly over-mushy and tasted like it was watered down. The teriyaki sauce had a water consistency so we avoided using it. The BBQ sauce also was a little more liquid-y than normal. The musubi's were edible, but 90% rice, not a lot of sauce and a very thin piece of spam/chicken katsu.

When I picked up the order, I foolishly brought it home without checking it and found that I only had 12 falafel (in addition to the dips and the pita bread). I called the restaurant indicating that I was missing a part of my order because I had ordered the combo appetizer and an extra 12 falafel. He said that the combo appetizer only includes dolmas and does not include any falafel...even though the website and the person I spoke to previously said it was included.

I can't believe this is chicken pad see ewe. Hella bland if I knew it was gonna be like this I would've returned it!

"I don't recommend this place specially if you have kids. We had a very bad experience here. We stayed in lone for one hour. They said their system is shot off and it will take more time.

They didn't take our order for half an hour! And after half an hour our order (just two) was not ready. They took order of other tables and they prepared orders for them but they didn't even look at us that were there. After two hours I got tired and told her but she didn't even apologized for that!!!

"So much potential- but also in its infant stages. Restaurant was a great idea, but still has some growing to do. Menu looked delicious - execution was not good. Our server Andres was great! Very attentive, helpful and tried his best.

Restaurant has a Bahamas/tropical feel. Ambience is not intended for family dining so if you have small children, do everyone a favor and eat elsewhere. We don't need to be subjected to the running & screaming.

- HOSTESS: Try to be attentive to the makeup of your patrons and seat groups with children at a distance far away from groups without. Our date night was subjected to the annoyance of a loud and rowdy table with two young children. Not an idea way to spend our Friday night.

- KITCHEN: Many disappointments through the night.

*Bread - Tasted stale, was cold & boring. No different than anything I could buy at a supermarket.

*Oysters - We got the Kumamoto, Kusshi & Mission. Our fave was of course the Kumamotos, but the others were good too. Unfortunately, our shucker was not so skilled. So many pieces of shell in our actual oysters made something so simple and fresh difficult to swallow.

*Cioppino - Great potential! Broth was delicious and the inclusion of Dungeness crab was a true plus. Unfortunately the preparations of the crab was the most disappointing part of our meal (to be continued)

*Ocean's Mixed Seafood - Again, so much potential. But very very poor execution. My clams tasted boiled with no flavor and was extremely gritty. Halfway through my meal I realized that my meal was missing mussels. Asked Andres who tried to make things right by asking the kitchen for it on the side, but was told they ran out and that's why they added additional flavorless, gritty clams... While my fianc�����'s cioppino had an abundance of mussels. Did the kitchen run out or they just didn't want to cop to their mistake? The rest was flavorful & delicious (except the crab). Loved the octopus! 

Typically when stuff like this happens, we would get an apology and something comped oed by management, but nope...

*Dungeness crab - The biggest disappointment of the night. Both of our crabs were over cooked, over salted, crab jerky. It tasted as if it was boiled early in the day and sat in salt water all day. Shells were not pre-cracked. Could not easily be cracked and were overly soft. Buffet crab tastes better than what we had. I understand that crab is not in season, but damn was this bad...


I understand that the restaurant is in its infancy state. The kitchen needs drastic improvements to succeed so I hope they take the feedback given.

I would happily return and give them another try if they take my suggestions to heart. Because again, so much potential to be great!",2,2,7,3,0
"Food is ok. We sometimes go there because it is convenient after shopping at Costco. That's it. Service is the worst here.

He got the saut�����ed chicken and mixed vegetable with rice which ended up being a pale stir-fry that looked extremely unappealing. He sa""okay"" and would not order it again.

I got the grilled beef and egg rolls with vermicelli. The egg rolls were crispy and the filling was pretty standard so I can't really complain there. However, the main parts of the dish, the beef and vermicelli, were bad to say the least. The beef was tough, lacked any kind of seasoning/flavor, and was chopped up extremely small. With both dishes, I felt jipped because the amount of meat was laughable. Don't even get me started with the verimicelli...the noodles weren't even cooked all the way through. I took one bite and the noodles broke. 

The only saving grace of my order had to be the spring rolls. Not sure how a Vietnamese restaurant can make a bad spring roll, but at least they did this right. Without the spring rolls, I would've given this place 1 star.

"I have to say this fast food seafood cafe is not really good. I tried crab Louie salad and it was ok. Not great. Cafe Plaza across the street has such a wonderful crab Louis salad for way less money and full of yummy veggies. Their greens are mixed greens which offers more variation & nutrients. These guys have just Romain lettuce which is more of a Cesar salad lettuce. The vinaigrette here was very much like oyster mignonette. Very sour like it was just red wine vinegar, oil (I don't think you are getting olive oil here) & onion. It didn't taste very good and I like vinegar dressings. Lot of people don't like onions but here the calamari salad is premixed and has small white onions in that you can't pick out. I would much rather see red onions cut into larger pieces so people can take them out. Also Plaza Cafe gives you a lot bigger portion and much better thousand island dressing. You'll get avocado, pickled beets (here the beets had no flavor, pickled beets are so much better!), beans, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots and more. However they give you very yummy sourdough bread on the side here. Sadly I'm on a ketogenic lifestyle and don't eat bread ;(
Overall I think this cafe gives you less for more money and it doesn't taste that good. Owners please go get the same salad next door at Plaza cafe so you know what you are competing with. I buy this salad for lunch few times per week. You want repeat business. Be better than your competition.",1,7,12,4,0

"Overpriced, subpar food.

Dynasty Bistro recently opened in the Ygnacio Plaza, replacing longtime tenant China Village. My friend Chuck and I had wanted to try this place for a while since we heard they serve dim sum. That opportunity finally came when we had lunch here on 10/24/2019 at 12:30 pm.

When I was walking up, I noticed the exterior sign still says ""China Village"". The place was about 60% full when I walked in. The interior had gone through a nice refurbishing. It had a very modern and casual vibe and looked nothing like a Chinese restaurant. Cleanliness was impeccable. The lone TV was replaying the Lakers/Clippers game from a couple nights prior.

The male owner came by with menus. He was polite and friendly. Their menu was a hodgepodge of northern/southern/Americanized Chinese dishes and looked identical to its predecessor except for a few new additions. To our disappointment, there were only a few dim sum items available. Lunch specials ranged from ~$11-$15 and ������ la carte dishes from ~$14-$17. 

For food, we ordered the Dynasty Noodle Soup (D05/$12.50), Green Onion Beef Lunch Special ($L27/$12.55 + $1 for fried rice), Har Gow King (A01/$6.25), and Siu Mai (A02/$4.95). We also tried to order Cha Siu Bao, bu""they haven't arrived yet"". That indicated their dim sum was not made in-house. 

The Har Gow King was absolutely atrocious. They appeared uniform (not made in-house). When I put my chopsticks to it, the skin immediately disintegrated, which indicated it was either oversteamed or resteamed. The filling was mushy and didn't taste fresh. At the price they charged, I expected a lot more.

The Siu Mai was so-so. They didn't appear to be oversteamed or resteamed. The filling tasted pretty average and held up okay. 

The Dynasty Noodle Soup I had was meh. It was a bowl of noodle soup topped with a stir-fry made with beef, chicken, shrimp, and assorted vegetables. The noodles were the store-bought Shangahinese type. While the proteins in the stir-fry tasted okay, the carrots and celery were way undercooked. They had a raw, salad-like taste to them. Also, the grease from the stir-fry sort of ruined the taste of the otherwise decent broth.

Chuck commented that his green onion beef tasted okay. But for the surcharge he paid, they could have given him a bit more fried rice.

The staff was friendly but service was hit-and-miss. We had to ask for water a couple of times and I had to get my own chopsticks for the noodle soup. One of the servers did come by to refill our water during our meal. 

All things considered, I would say this place needs a lot of improvement in order to achieve long-term success. Right now, the price point and quality just don't match. They will either have to lower their price point (which I don't see happening) or improve on the quality of their food. For me, I will only return if someone really wants to eat here.

Food was alright. I personally think it was over priced. I was craving a carne asada burrito but when i saw that the carne asada had green peppers it killed me. (Dont like peppers) and then i saw the rice had veggies and it wasnt plain something else that i dislike. Asked for guacamole. It needed salt and smaller pieces of onion(had more onions then avocado) for $1.50 for about 1 tablespoon of guac. Not worth it. The al pastor wasnt crispy at all mainly just sitting in grease. Honestly i would never go back. Chipotle gives bigger servings and more flavor for less. The only reason why i gave it that many stars was because they were quick at serving and gave me chips with my quesadilla of al pastor.,2,0,0,0,0

Anyway, the dish was solid, but at $50.99, I can think of a HUNDRED better food options at that price. 

Individually, I ordered the Galbi Tang (#2 on the menu) which had seemingly a different kind of beef short rib - reddish, almost pastrami-like. I thought it was great actually but there just wasn't enough clear noodles. That's an easy cost effective fix that they can make.

"Shake Shack tries to earn its footing here in the West Coast, but with quality like this, it may be standing on shaky ground. 

Even though Shake Shack has been open for a while now, the little establishment was still jam packed with eager patrons for an early Saturday evening. And while a crowd normally spells good food, it wasn't the case here. 

Firstly, the self-serving ordering system is wholly unnecessary. Not only did it require you to share your phone number for them to let you know your food is ready, but there were also plenty of customers who had a hard time navigating the menu, causing a huge back-up. What's wrong with normal counter service? Getting a free table meant lurking around and jumping the minute someone stands up, and for a space so small, it felt awkward to say the least. 

For our dinner, I got the SmokeShack while the hubby chose the Chick'n Shack and to share, we ordered fries, the black and white shake, and a fresh lemonade. Let's start off with the best items: the shake and the fries. The fries were fried to perfection and the crinkle shape made for easy dipping. The chocolate and vanilla shake was decadent, but not too sweet. Super good!

Unfortunately, everything else fell flat. The SmokeShack had a meaty patty, but I was disappointed that the burger wasn't served with any lettuce or tomatoes to add some brightness. The buns, while buttery, were too soft and the size of the burger itself was certainly small for the price. The hubby never raved about his fried chicken sandwich, noting that it wasn't anything special. The chicken had a good crispy extieror and it was somewhat juicy, but the hefty price didn't feel justified. Also, the ""fresh"" lemonade certainly tasted like false advertising. 

In the end, we paid over $30 for our meal and for ""fast food"" it was certainly expensive. After our hectic dinner here, let's just say we were better off going to an actual restaurant and enjoying some burgers there.",2,44,71,63,0

"Since the son took over this place, this restaurant went from hole in a wall to shit in a hole. I'm the first customer when this place opened, long before it went viral in social media. I go there almost every day and especially weekends. His parents were the only one who are managing the shop. The mom mainly do all the cooking and the dad did all the preparation. Back then its 100% chicken, lightly breaded. Now its 90-100% bread and if you're lucky you'll might get a tiny piece of meat inside.

I get it, you have heavy bass music which filled with profanities and offensive rap music to please the millennials, graffiti walls and nonsensical stickers, but what about the quality of the food? You dumb down that as well? Is it because you believe that people who enjoys 90s rap music should only deserve garbage ingredients. Even other fried chicken franchise with their processed meat has better quality of meat than what the son turned this place into.

The flavor and ingredients are different from when the old couple started. Now, it's just sugar, food coloring and breading. No actual hardship went into making the food in this place. 
This place is an perfect example of not taking the pictures you see in social media as is. Just because it looks good in the picture with all the filter they used to make it look appetizing. In reality, eating at this place can kill you faster than if you went to eat at a fast food joint.

Photos of our lunch are attached to the review. In all honesty, I can only describe the food as overly greasy and salty. I felt uncomfortably heavier when we left as if I just consumed an entire meal of oil and sodium. After today's experience, it would be a hard sell for me to return.",2,1,0,0,0
"This an amazing place. Very fine dining and relaxed at the same time. Very nice staff and pleasant all around. But...

My husband and I went there and they had this family of six was being very rude and loud. They even shouted from their table to ours that we were ""Exicans"" because we were trying to have a meal in a place where that family thought we didn't belong. 

So we complain to the manager, and he says they're in a bind. They can't kick them out and their solution was (instead of asking them to be quiet) was to move us, an Asian couple and a black couple to this walled off section near the entrance but behind the bar, where we were supposed to finish our meal. 

But the night and the 15 year anniversary we're ruined so loud people could be racist, rude, and actively obnoxious. They took glee in other people's frustration and the worst part is the manager had absolutely zero spine to say anything to these people. 

We and others were extremely uncomfortable and upset while they laughed and had the time of their lives. 

We will go again I think but not for a while.",2,0,11,0,0

Went in this last weekend and same issues. The food was good, but again with the service. I went in there with my husband and friend. It wasn't that busy...we sat at the bar.

"You'd think if you specialized in ONE THING like wings you'd be really good at it.

NOPE not at the Wingstop on Monument BLVD. 

I made a large combo order for pickup and I love parmesan garlic wings. I had been waiting all day to pig out and was feeling pretty excited about it. 

HERES WHY ONLY TWO STARS. 

1) The Parmesan garlic wings were nothing more than butter with a little Parmesan sprinkled on top. 

2) The staff barley seemed to care about anything. The place appeared to be 100% run by teenagers that just didn't have direction or give a damn. 

3) When I got home, my fries were missing. I was pissed but mistakes happen right? When I called to let them know they barley seemed to care. They said I can drive back down to get them if I wanted... sorry no I don't want to drive down there again

I can get more flavorful tacos at a lower price at California Fish grill across the street which is not even a taqueria.

This was probably the worst service and food I've had in a long time. For some reason the server just a bad attitude towards us. We ordered calamari app it so over cooked the calamari actually shrunk inside the breading. My fries were so over cooked they where closer to potato chips then fries. I ordered a 1/2 pound burger which I didn't get. The patty was maybe 3 inches in diameter and it was placed on a bun that was 5 inches in diameter. It was all bread. My son ordered a plain cheeseburger when he received it the cheese on it was still cold. When I asked the waitress if she could take it back and maybe melt the cheese.

"I ordered Pad Thai, Green Beef Curry when Thai Corner first opened to take home for Dinner and it was a great meal full of flavor. I took my wife to have lunch given the first great positive experience and was so disappointed that we left the food on the table with a very bad taste in our mouths. This time we ordered Calamari which came in a batter fried with squid that tasted like rubber and was very hard that we could not eat it. We told our waitress and we said if we could get something else instead and we traded it for the spring rolls. The spring rolls came really fast so we were happy at first, but then noticed the lettuce and vegetables were very stale and yellowish in color not fresh at all. This time we had ordered the green curry beef and pad Thai again. The food tasted terrible this time, and we felt that it had to be a new or different cook at lunch time because it wasn't like the time the week before. The curry had an excessive amount of coconut and meat was not flavorful at all. The pad Thai was a mush of a strange flavor that tasted like iron not at all like a Pad Thai is supposed to taste. We have been to many great Thai places and it is really disappointing that a new restaurant in our neighborhood would be so inconsistent in the quality of the experience. Our waitress noticed we asked for the check and did not even care to inquire about the why we had left all the food on the table after just 10 minutes. She just handed us the check for $41.76 and said nothing (September 16th 2019 transaction) . We paid and left without even bothering. I think it is really sad and terrible how a new restaurant with a huge capital investment just does not train or care to know why new customers would walk out on their food.

"Your NO NONESENSE REVIEW! I only rate the food, I don't care if the waitress calls me ugly then flips me off, as long as the food is good.

NOTE: I understand this place is more of a bar and this may be good food if you are drunk, but if your just getting food DO NOT GO HERE! Italian Gardens ""chefs"" microwaving your ""fresh"" pasta is better experience. But, if you like many beers, football and shitty predictable music this place is for you!

Anyways.. I ordered the Nashville spicy sandwich. At around 15 bucks and labeled ""feature"" this better give chick fil-a a freaking run for its money... Worst fried food sandwich of my life.... It was dripping oil. The cook, besides overcooking it pulled the chicken out of the frier and just ploped it on the bun. I never complain but I told waitress that I did not want discount or anything but inform the cook that you have to drain the oil for at least a min or two before putting it on the bun. The oil made a 5 inch puddle on the plate to the fact I set the sandwich on the bare table in between bites. The meat was dry but well seasoned. The spice level was non existence, about same as chick fil a spicy sandwich. I LOVE chick fil a.. LOVE it. I feel bad I could have ate 4+ of their delicious moist savory to die for chicken sandwiches for the price I paid for this cat food. Keep in mind this item was a ""featured"" item meaning ""this is what we are known for"". Also they put a thin layer of the worst coleslaw you could ever taste below a piping hot oil dripping protein so the coleslaw lost all crunch and was kind of wilted. They did not get their slaw right. Just mayo and sugar with maybe some paprika and salt. It was again too sweet and none to little vinegar. Slaws tang is supposed to offset the oil in a breaded sandwich. Bun was acceptable. SCORE: 0/10

My wife got an appetizer for coconut shrimp. 4 deeply battered, slightly overcooked shrimp arrived. I believe they used the thick sweetened coconut milk as the moisture agent to batter the shrimp and then coated with dry sweetened coconut. It was obnoxiously sweet. And then you dip it in another sweetened sauce? Come on.. again this food is for an alcoholic with no sense of taste. Score: 0/10

Kids got a cheese pizza. I took a nibble and it was fresh made and slightly sour, not sure if dough was sourdough, I doubt it, prob just canned tomatoes that were not balanced properly or tasted by a professional cook. Score: Pizza/10

Finally got a clam chowder as side, pretty good, maybe slightly over seasoned. But, I can 10000000 percent grantee this is canned and came like that. Score: Canned soup/10

Wife got some steak thing and sweet potato mashed.. did not try, she said it was good. Score: wife/10

Also had side fries. Score: bagged frozen fries/10

Side note if any staff read this... I was in military, if you are getting chewed out or corrected, just smile and nod and agree. I was not chewing out all I said was to tell cook to properly drain oil... Waitress ""Oh thats not oil it is just hot sauce"".. I have worked several years in food industry..... IF I AM TELLING YOU ITS OIL DO NOT CORRECT ME MUPPET! Anyways... Like I said, kind of pricey, but this may be a good choice if you are sick of buffalo wild wings for drink night..

"I have to say I am so beyond disappointed. 

I don't usually take the time to write reviews, preferring to read other people's reviews to discover new places, but this is an instance where I felt misled by all the glowing recommendations. 

I wanted to try this place because I haven't been and the menu looked good. Got seated around 1:45pm and then proceeded to wait almost 45min for our orders of shrimp and chives dumpling and Xiao long bao. We had a third and final order of the spicy pork wontons that never arrived, and the next thing we knew, it was 2:45pm and the server plopped down our check. We were sitting there like patient idiots waiting for our food that never arrived and we were still hungry!! The portions are tiny, each dumpling are bite-sized. 

When I went to the counter to tell them they've made a mistake, at first the guy tells me it's normal to wait 35-45min for food and then he tells me the kitchen closed at 2:30pm. When he finally shut up long enough to listen, he said he will tell the kitchen to make up the order but it will take around 10 more minutes (which is a lie since he has just told me they make things fresh and it will take half an hour). 

At this point, I had explained repeatedly that we had placed our orders over an hour ago and way before kitchen closing time, and would like to get at least some concessions for the lost time since we do not want to wait any longer for the missing order. He at first said there's nothing he can do, and then finally comes back with 15% off the total.

What an absolute clusterfuck of an experience. I am still hungry, and pissed, and will advise everyone I know to pick anywhere else for better quality service and bigger portions.

They told us it was a 45 minute wait, they'd text us when our table was ready, we decided to sit at the bar to watch the game and wait. 4 beers & 2 glasses of wine later, (about 35 mins) we got seated.

So for starters, they don't have TV's but on the left side of the restaurant (bar only) where we were seated we couldn't even see the game!! What kind of place has only 4 very little tv's, and only near the bar? We moved our seats to try and get a little bit of the tv. We got an okay view.

"Actually a 2.5. Sunday Brunch on 10/20/19. A friend kindly treated me to brunch here for my birthday before roaming the Danville Fall Fest. She gave me the choice of any downtown restaurant - I picked Harvest because I'd never been there. 

We didn't have reservations, but there were plenty of tables inside and out. I knew the brunch menu would be limited - no problem. Friendly greeting from the hostess. My friend announced that we were there for my birthday. A cheerful ""happy birthday."" We opted for outside in the heated area (it was colder inside than outside!). All good so far. 

We were seated at 11:15 AM. We were brought water and menus. Another table near us was seated at 11:25 (I had my phone out because I'd planned on taking photos.) Their order was taken by a waiter at 11:30. We waited, and finally after waving at a waitress, our order was taken at 11:40. A 25 minute wait wouldn't have bothered me if it was crowded - or if people who were seated after us weren't served first. We both ordered the Country Breakfast Plate ($14) - two eggs, choice of sausage or bacon, potatoes, and biscuit with maple syrup butter. The food was good (we both asked for our bacon ""crispy"" and they nailed that), but no maple syrup butter, and we had to ask for that and for salt and pepper (not on the table). But they didn't come, and plate and biscuit were getting cold. So I went inside to ask hostess if someone could bring the butter, and to tell our waitress that I would just pick up salt and pepper from an uncleared table. 

Again, the food was good - nothing outstanding. But after we were done, and plates were cleared, no check! My friend had to go inside to ask for the check. By this time there were people lined up waiting for tables - tables could have been turned much faster if folks got their checks! Oh, and a whiny comment - most restaurants, when they know you're celebrating a birthday, at least would put a candle in your biscuit (the one without butter) or comp one hush puppy, or wish you a happy birthday as you left - or something! I really appreciate my friend's treat - but I'm sorry I picked Danville Harvest.",2,0,1,0,0
"I ate lunch here and started vomiting ~6 hours later. The only other food I ate that day was oatmeal and vegetables I cooked at home, so it's very likely that I got food poisoning from eating here - specifically I believe the shrimp papaya salad made me sick.

I wish I had looked at their health scores before eating here - the critical violation of ""proper hot and cold holding temperatures"" shows up repeatedly, including on the most recent inspection. There's even a Yelp review from Feb 2016 that mentions sushi and shrimp on a salad being held in a non-functioning cooler. Probably the banh mi is ok safety-wise, but I would definitely avoid the packaged food (and obviously I personally will not return here).

----

Some other info:

They're cash only. They serve banh mi and noodle soups, in addition to prepackaged food (that I would avoid for the above reasons). I tried:

- #7. BBQ char siu sandwich (banh mi xa xiu) ($3.50) - very good value. The bread isn't super great but it's toasted; overall tasty and for the price you really can't complain.

- Shrimp papaya salad ($4.50) - low quality shrimp probably made me sick. The box in the display fridge outside is just papaya and carrots, but I bought it assuming the rest of the ingredients were probably underneath. When they weren't I returned to ask about it (and got the response ""Oh, you wanted shrimp? Some people don't like it, you know."" ???) but they took my box into the back and gave me a different salad with shrimp/peanuts/cilantro a few minutes later. Besides the shrimp it wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't worth the food poisoning.",1,5,11,2,0

"Review #138 - 2019

I had this place bookmarked after seeing that it's a new spot with some good reviews.

After our shopping trip at 99 Ranch, the boys & I were starving so we couldn't wait another 20 minutes for New Dumpling to open up at 5 PM. That was a big mistake, we should've waited!

We showed up around 4:40 PM & were seated right away. We actually found a parking spot right in front of the restaurant so we were pretty happy with ourselves.

After seating us & giving us our menus, the waitress went back to doing her chores & sweeping. She came back about 10 minutes later to take our orders.

I went to the bathroom & came back to find that she'd brought us some plates & water. My plate had a piece of hair on it & my water glass looked filthy so I asked her to get me a new set.

When she came back, I noticed she was wearing the same pair of gloves that she used to clean with so I was turned off. She kept her gloves on the whole time that she was serving our food. I'd say that's not proper food handling practice!
 
I ordered the green onion pancake to start off with since that's probably the only thing that my daughter could eat, but she only ate one piece & the boys finished the rest.

I also ordered the salt & pepper wings for the boys to share since they were starving, but it showed up last so I ended up eating it as my meal. It's probably the only dish that we all agreed was worth eating.

I ordered the Hainan chicken rice plate as my main dish & I couldn't eat more than 2 bites because the chicken smelled terrible. My son ended up helping me finish the rice, but he didn't touch the chicken at all.

My son ordered the black bean noodles, which he ate, but complained about the whole time. He just said, ""mom, let's not try a new restaurant next time we're starving to save ourselves from this type of disappointment in the future."" I highly agreed!

My nephew got the jiangxi noodles, which was actually ok.

Overall, I should've known that I'd be disappointed since the menu already stated that they don't use MSG. I have eaten at enough of these places that claim not to use MSG & brag that their food is still tasty. Sorry, but everything was super salty & we will not be coming back.

After we left the restaurant, my son started complaining of feeling like throwing so it must have been the Hainan chicken rice plate that got to him.",1,8,29,16,0
"Okay, I gave this place a month to right the ship and, if possible, it was worse than the first time. 

Good news! They do have beer on tap now, but that's the only good news I experienced...

I ordered the ""Hot"" Nashville sandwich, which they were serving this time. Unfortunately, 20 minutes later, this sandwich came on a stone cold bun and the meat was barely warm when I bit into it. 

I sent the sandwich back, telling the waitress it was cold and, twenty-five minutes later, she brought me another sandwich on another dead cold bun. I didn't even try to bite into it this time and asked for a refund and sent it back immediately after just touching it to try to sense some warmness. 

Astoundingly, when I asked the ""crew"" if they customarily served these hot sandwiches on cold buns, I was greeted with nothing but blank stares... amazing!

This place needs a serious kick in the butt to bring it up to the high standards set by the other branches I have visited and I hope they get their act together soon. They will not be getting me back anytime soon...",1,1,0,1,0
I was in San Francisco last week. A group of fifteen of us decided to go to this restaurant for dinner on Sunday 10/20/2019. We ordered Tahdig with Ghormeh Sabzi and Fesenjoon and Gheimeh Bademjoon. All were good except Badmjoon was placed on the plate cold. We all ordered Soltani at$45 a plate. I have had Soltani at many persian restaurants. This was by far the WORST I had ever had. The Koobideh was very thin and falling apart. Both Koobideh and Barg were burned black. The waiter disappeared afterwards.

"I've been eyeing this dim sum location for a long time based on its reviews, but was pretty disappointed. There's a good amount of seating, but interior seemed pretty old.

Tins offers many traditional dim sum dishes, but quality was low compared to some other places in the East Bay. 

-Siu mai: 4 pieces and were small. The meat didn't taste fresh
-Beef balls: Standard, I liked the chewiness.
-Fried pork dumplings: 3 pieces, came out cold
-Beef stew and rice rolls in clay pot: Don't even bother. The beef was tough and had a sour taste. Rice noodles plainly tossed in a light soy sauce/oyster sauce concoction topped with a few pieces of green onion.

Probably won't return because there are many other dim sum spots in the Bay Area that deliver at a higher quality at almost the same price.",2,0,2,0,0
"I have visited this establishment, once by myself, at the recommendation of a colleague, and once with my wife. I ordered the lasagna both times: the first time, it was so-so, so I gave it another try. Still the same. Overpriced as well. 
The second visit, my wife ordered the shrimp scampi which came out like soup with entirely too much lemon. She didn't eat it. 
I hear their prime rib night is to die for, so I plan to give them one more chance to redeem themselves. 
They also leave their door open when the restaurant is closed. Irritating to walk in an unlocked door and be refused service. They should put the closed sign on the door!
Even for California, the prices are too high. Should have a hostess on duty.

"I am basing this review on the entire experience, not just the food. The only thing that was good was the pizza. It wasn't the best, wasn't the worst, just right down the middle. 

The problem was the other people in the restaurant. There was a birthday party or a quinceanera or something going on over in the large section to the left. And the game was on. The one where Manning beat Farve's TD record. Much too drunk and much too loud. We couldn't sit in the middle section because all the available tables were dirty. So we were forced to sit in the game area. Prior to sitting down, I was almost mowed down by some fatty at the salad bar. Ironic, huh? 

It probably wouldn't have been that bad, but these unruly, sticky ass, nasty kids thought this was a damn playground. I don't care if it's got a few arcade games, it's still a restaurant. These parents were horrible. Not once did they keep their kids in line or check on them. One kid ate shit running around and hurt his leg. He was on the floor crying. No parent came to check on him. 

I then told the guy at the counter we wanted to change our order to go, and told him why. He acted like he didn't really care about the craziness in his restaurant. Then again, I am not spending hundreds of dollars on pizza for a party. But, unlike the patrons at the birthday party, I Yelp.

Oh, and after I ordered, I went to the bathroom to wash up. No paper towels. No, they weren't out, they don't offer them. They do have an electric hand dryer though. Too bad it didn't work.

"first visit here. 

we ordered:

1. boba tea
2. Vietnamese ice coffee 
3. crispy spicy chicken 
4. bangkok kt noodle with pork belly plus all free toppings 
5. pork belly jian bing

review:

1. boba tea: good/ok can taste the oolong. boba is slightly under cook. rated this as 2.5 out of 5. 

2. vietnamese ice coffee: meh. tasted like artificial creamer. very sub par compared to many standard places that sell vietnamese ice coffee in bay area. rated 1 out of 5. 

3. crispy spicy chicken. texture: good. crispy. lightly breaded. taste: blah. plain. very dry inside. cannot even taste any salt nor spice at all. without the crispy texture and the sauces available on the condiments table, this would rated much lower fir me. rated: 1.75 out of 5. 

4. bangkok kt stir fry noodle: not sure how to put this kindly: uneatable. noodles were slightly over cooked (too soft). very sour and no heat. absolutely would not be able to sell this noodle in bangkok, not even on the cheapest street version that we had in bkk recently. 1000000000000x better there. 0 taste of bangkok in this noodle. absolutely not a chef who made this noodle or the standard recipe was completely bad to begin with. had to pour in the thai sweet sauce (3 cups) into the noodle before they are eatable. 

twas a soft sour unappetizing blobs. absolutely not recommended. -10 stars. travesty of any noodle. 

5. pork belly jian bing (ordered extra, extra crispy)

did not come that crispy (crispy inside a little). 

we actually like this one. if this was the only item we ordered plus the boba tea, the rating would be much higher overall. 

good flavors inside. good combination within the jian bing. will come back for this one alone. 2.8 stars out of 5. 

overall rating for this visit 1.49stars. would be below 1 without the jian bing and boba tea",1,0,1,0,0

"I really want to like this place. My family seems to be impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant, the friendly staff, and the delicious food. I agree with them except the latter. 

My clams were very dehydrated. The clams were shriveled up in the shell, meatless. The rib eye looked very dry and thin, granted my son and brother liked it. The crab appeared very enticing with all the veggie decoration that filled the shell. Again, I expected more crab meat, but that was not to be. The sauce, however, was yummy. The desserts felt store bought that was simply warmed up and served. 

We came on a busy night. Per our server, he has not seen the place bustling as it did that Saturday night since they opened two months ago. Funny that for a busy night, our party of nine had no wait time, the waiting area was bare, and the place pretty much looked chill.

"I was SO excited to try this place out, but it unfortunately disappointed me :(. I'm a huge Asian food lover and especially enjoy trying cuisines outside the usual realm, like Malaysian, Nepalese, Singaporean, etc. Given the reviews I was stoked to check out this Malaysian spot. I had eaten at Kedai Makan in Seattle and was jonesing for something just as outstanding.

I ordered the Hokkien Mee Noodles as my dish. I waited about 10-15 minutes before it was ready in a to go container. The dish looks fantastic, which got me eager. 

However, upon digging in, I found a sweet, ultra saucy, dish. There was literally sauce (tasted a bit like soy sauce) just sitting at the bottom, and a white sauce that contributed to the sweet intensity on top. This dish could have been SO good if it was sauced less and wasn't as sweet as it came out to be. I had to douse it in chili sauce and dry out the regular sauce with a napkin. 

Take caution coming here. If you prefer subtler flavors that are tastefully brought together like me, you may not enjoy this food. But if you like bold super saucy options, this is likely your spot :).

I'll update this review if I try another dish :).",2,0,0,1,0
"Actually I would say 2.5 stars. The meal was decent and the prices was a little higher than other places. The miso soup was somewhat bland and salty. The portion of the protein was quite small compared to the portions of the other items served with the meal.

We had to ask two waitresses for the edamame beans appetizer for checking in on the Yelp app and had to wait 15 - 20 minutes to receive it. After receiving it from one waitress, the other one almost immediately brought another portion and was upset that we had already received it. Then, she looked around the restaurant and served the bowl of edamame beans to another table of patrons who stated they didn't order them, but ate them anyway.

The reason for my star rating is due to the lack of customer service, having to wait a long time for our meal to be served (other parties that ordered after we did were served before us), and being rushed to pay the bill. However, there was only one other table being occupied at the time...so it was not busy at this time.",2,0,0,0,0

Rude!!! 
I tried the ton-katsu donburi. It came with a side salad and miso soup. I expected the katsu to be more crispy but it was actually pretty soggy. The rice was chewy and there was some sauce mixed with it but really not enough to mix with all the rice. They could have mixed more in forsure.

"It is sad when a restaurant that once prepared good food has such a noticeable slide. The ribs and eggplant were inedible as the ribs tasted old or spoiled. In addition they were not cooked properly as they were tough instead of falling off the bone tender. We should have left immediately when the laminated menu presented to us was incredibly soiled. It was so bad that I mentioned it to the wait staff but received no response.

Although I enjoyed slip and slide as a child I do not enjoy it in a restaurant's rest room. All manner of fluids provide a challenge to negotiate the restroom's floor. I have never felt like a restaurant was less concerned with my enjoyment, sanitation or satisfaction.

Service was good! We had a kind worker serve us. She even hand delivered our drinks to us. Interior was really clean and nice! Seems like a good space to hang out in. 

Now for the cons:
I got a rose black tea and my friend got a milk tea. The rose tea was very sweet and had an odd flavor--not my favorite. Boba was watery and not flavorful. 
The only way I can describe the taste of the milk tea is mushy peas????? Like baby food??? It definitely was a taste that was anything but milk tea. I don't know. Weird. 

Also another weird observation: straws were not individually wrapped and next to several containers of seasoning powder (ie garlic, onion powder etc). Cross contamination??? Maybe we can try a straw dispenser?

Vegetable Noodle Soup - Lacked flavor, dumped chugs of red vinegar to bring out any taste. Asked for flat noodles, and the waiter said ""sorry, we can't do that for you. Maybe nex time."" They didn't even give me the option to order another bowl, just ""sorry, no.""

If the restaurant's specialty was in hand pulled noodles, why would they not offer it? And instead be resistant to letting you order it?

Tomato Beef Noodles - Average, pleasant tomato taste.

"TL;DR Food poisoning guaranteed

I would be very careful if you choose to eat here. I am not joking when I say practically everything they serve has spoiled in some way. Boiled broccoli was grey/brown when served, radish kimchi was not crunchy, the list goes on. When they served our entrees (Mul Naengmyeon and Seolleongtang), the meat was off and funky. Also the broth in the cold noodles was already pretty sour before we put any vinegar in, which is definitely not supposed to happen. I usually put a price to value on my reviews, but I cannot in this case as I would not eat it even if it were free.

"Filipino food seems to be on the rise here in San Leandro! I had never heard of this place near my home until I came back recently for a visit. While the usual tapsilog meal I get is in Hayward, I figured this would be worth a shot on a sunny afternoon.

Parekoy Lutong Pinoy is a family owned business that sits on the south end of East 14th. I came here with two things in mind: their pork sisig ($11) and the lumpia shanghai ($9). In order for you to use a credit card, you must spend at least $20, so I tacked on a side of garlic rice to get me to that point.

Luckily I did because that garlic rice honestly saved the meal for me.

The crispy pork sisig was interesting. I had never had sisig that was filled almost entirely with onion and mayo. There was a lot of overpowering flavor in this dish that eventually I gave up on trying to finish it. Each bite needed to be combined with garlic rice to make it more edible. It wasn't a terrible sisig (and quite frankly, the first few bites were great), but after a while they needed to be thrown out.

When I bit into their small pieces of lumpia, I was sad that the flavor I was expecting was not there. The lumpia was okay but I felt it could have used better frying oil. It also seemed pricey overall for my meal.

I'm sad that Parekoy wasn't able to deliver for me. I am going to stick with my usual spot elsewhere.",2,4,3,2,0

"Um they need to seriously update their menu b/c it looks sooo tacky when they use white-out & sharpie = unprofessional. Like seriously, almost every page has white-out. Some of the dishes that they have on their menu has ""N/A""... What the heck... then remove it..

We checked on Yelp & specifically came to this place b/c of the Happy Hour special, just to be disappointed that they got rid of it. Bummer. We all decided to just stay & eat here since we all have never been. 

While browsing through the menu, we wanted to try their cheese corn b/c it looked good (our server also highly recommended it). We then had a convo about how there is not many places that offer cheese corn. We excitedly placed 2 orders of cheese corn hoping that our day would get better with the cheese corn. 5 minutes later, our server came back & said that the chef ran out of cheese corn...... Ugh.. just what I wanted to hear!!! Disappointed yet AGAIN. 

The only thing I liked was how the Lion King roll (baked salmon on top of California roll) was $8. Normally other places charge a little bit more so I was really happy about that. We didn't have to sacrifice the quality with the price. The other rolls were just meh. Nothing special. Not much interesting or unique sushi roll selections. They all seem to taste the same after a few bites. On a good note: they gave each person free miso soup! Idk if they normally give that out or b/c we didn't get our cheese corn (I forget).. 

Ok so not having HH special did not stop us from ordering drinks. We got Pineapple Soju, which was not bad. We made sake bombs (first timer ayy!!) & I would like to give a s/o to our server for being so accommodating & providing us with more chopsticks as it fell on the ground :/ oops lol. 

Hmm I think I would ONLY come for the Lion King roll... b/c of the price. As for yummy & unique rolls, I suggest going to Cha Cha sushi (sorry not sorry).",2,2,2,1,0
"I seldom gave bad reviews but I'm honestly very disappointed with their quality / taste of food. 

We arrived at 5:30pm and waited for 30 minutes to get seated. There are plenty empty tables with the prior customers leftovers but the waiters are too busy with taking care of other customers and checking with the kitchen to clean them. It took us longer (for about an hour after we ordered) for the food to come to the table. I'm generally okay with waiting if the food is good. I've had many Kalbi Jims and this was honestly the worst among all I've tried in terms of flavor and most expensive in terms of portion. 

Spicy Kalbi Jim 1/5 
We ordered the large spicy Kalbi Jim. It had too much sauce covering the short ribs and veggies, making you only taste the sauce and nothing else. And it's definitely way overpriced: 6 short ribs in a large portion. If you want to come here for their Kalbi Jim, I would recommend Daeho in SF Japantown or Sun Nong Dan in LA. 

York Jeon 3/5 
Nothing special about the wayu. I won't order it again for $23. 

Kalbi Tang 4/5 
The kalbi tang was pretty good and the kalbi was pretty tender. but they gave too much bean sprouts:( it makes the entire soup taste only like bean sprouts. 

Environment 4/5 
Like they positions themselves as a modern Korean restaurant, the interior is very modern with a black themed building and booths. 

Service 4/5
The service was very good! The only thing that makes me feel back about giving a two star review is the service. The staff are very friendly and they felt very sorry about us waiting so long for the food and they gave us another set of the banchan.",2,0,7,0,0

"If there is one thing a Southerner can be proud of (and there may just be the one), it's the traditional flavors of Deep South cooking. Enter NOLA: What a sad state of affairs and total disappointment. What happened in the last year? Food used to be decent at least. I considered contacting the owners first but decided there is no way they would care. If they did, I wouldn't have had this regrettable experience. I know gritty, hole in the wall eateries well. and have frequented many in my life. The environment here in no remote way impacted my experience. The food was just awful and way over-priced. I'm from the South and have eaten in dozens of New Orleans restaurants over the last 30 years. The worst I've had beats NOLA hands down, served cold in the rain. I got eight 45 count frozen fried shrimp that were fried until every drop of moisture was wicked from their shriveled carcass for just $13.90. The price of a pound (45 shrimp) of domestic raw shrimp from the seafood counter. I know my shrimp. My grandfather took me shrimping in the summers. This shrimp was embarrassed to be served. Also got a 1/2 bowl (12-16 oz) of Red Beans and rice that was no better. Minute rice, 4 quarters of a 1/4"" round slice of link sausage (about 1.5 ozs sausage) served in a mush of bean porridge with no depth of flavor hardly needed teeth to slurp down, for $9.95. In fact the only flavor that came through was hot peppers. As if they thought numbing your tastebuds would mask the total absence of flavor. The folks are from New Orleans? New Orleans, Minnesota, maybe. This food wouldn't be served in the worst, cheapest restaurant in New Orleans. And this is a cheap dish to make. 
If this had been one bad dish i would have given them a pass. But not for 3 bad dishes. Po-boy is in your name. I just feel sorry for the po' boy that eats one. Please don't think this is creole cooking. To the owners: please close up shop today and find something you can be passionate about. It clearly isn't the flavors of New Orleans - not any more anyway.

As we waited for our food another customer came in and she was rude to him. He told her about herself and said he will never come back here again.

"Well I usually don't bother with the yelp, but I feel like this guy is daring me to critique his establishment by treating me like a steaming pile of shit. 

I'll keep this as objective as possible. 

I walked into this renovated house that was been housing this restaurant for 17 years (I learned this through attempted small talk, but this was all I could pry out of this real sparkling personality). I'm wearing casual attire, which is why I think he's giving me literally the worst service of my life. 

Ok just read some other reviews. I guess this guy just sucks. Is he an owner?

Note: I am a local. This is a weekday. I'm the guy you want to give great service to. Also there is only some old lady at the bar. It is otherwise 100% empty. 

I ask what the standouts are. He asks if I've looked at the menu. Yeah of course I have. ""Have you not eaten any of these before."" Really? Alrighty then. I order prosciutto wrapped prawns. ""What are the standout entrees though? I had rib eye the other night"" I say trying to show him that I'm a force to be reckoned with! Rib eye mother fucker! From Costco, no bone but still. I'm *legit*. He mutters something about the lamb. ""I'll take it!"" with a smile, trying to get a reaction. 

That was 10 minutes ago and he's been chatting cordially to the lady at the bar since. So he does have it in him to be human. Still no one else at the restaurant. 

I came here because I have a night off from wife (out of town) and kids (with my mother). Good restaurants are sparse in CV/Hayward. I should have just gone to a sports bar. Yeah I'm going to leave. Ah shit he just brought me the starter. It's fine. This place likes balsamic too much though. 

The lamb is very good. Nice spice to it, could use a little more salting. The pilaf is very good. 

I am not getting dessert even though I'd love some. I'm heading to a place with people and service. I would have loved to enjoy my dinner. Ideally I'd have 3 or more glasses of wine and a fat plate of dessert. 

My wife would kill me but I'm not tipping (let the record show that I usually tip 20% after tax). And Maybe I'll steal a fork.

Anyways, I'm a conscientious Yelper. They have a bunch of high ratings so I feel ok giving them a mediocre one.

They've only been open a couple days. Came to try it out based on all the glowing reviews. When I sat down at the restaurant and checked the reviews for what to order, noticed a lot of the reviewers only had one review on their entire account. These recently made accounts seemed to artificially boost their ratings. 

My coworker and I then ordered two dishes. They said, ""there's a three order MINIMUM for two people.""

Ok. Weird. There was nothing on the menu that said that. No one told us that too.

The best way I can explain this is some of them looked big and juicy and the other ones looked like they had been bought frozen from Walmart. Because of the size difference, the shrimp were nice but the smaller, Walmart quality ones, were extremely hard. They were very chewy and tasted like rubber! The Diabla sauce just wasn't like it usually was when I go home and visit. It was very odd seeing shrimps of all sizes in my plate when they usually give me the nice big ones.

The food portion is so small, not to mention they are also quite expensive. The shrimps are not deveined at all. They use unfresh shrimps. The sauce is not impressive. The garlic bread is burned. When asked to change one, they simply roughly scrape off the burned parts, with less bread to serve us. The fresh oysters are not prepared and cleaned properly - full of sand and shell chips.

Well this place brings in joy and promises to the Tri Valley Area! Amazing service, awesome staff.. 
shout out to Shanty!!! She made it sure that we enjoy every moment at The Salt..

We celebrated our special occasion here and we made the right decision. In the neighborhood we don't have as many places that would serve good food, good cocktails and especially all of that with amazing presentation worth representing in 'Michelin recommended' list in the East Bay!! 

The owner wants to really bring about an experience for every customer and takes great pleasure in talking about food, restaurants and accepts feedback. He wants to bring a 'good fine dining in East Bay' and I love that effort because that will save me a trip all the way to San Francisco or Palo Alto or Los Altos since I live in the East Bay. 

Cocktails are amazing!! This could be the next go to bar that is like a bar in SF city.. but in East Bay!!! How cool!!!!

Try their Lamb ribs, small plates and their Cake Jamun and sweet potato churros.. definitely in league with top SF places such as Rooh and August 1 Five!

The service was terrible. Honestly, if you're a first timer at a dim sum place like this where they roll carts and ask you what you want, you're screwed. The ladies do not talk and if you ask them what they have in their cart, they don't respond. Thankfully, my co-workers knew what they wanted so I picked off of their food. 

To be honest, the meat quality seemed to be not so great. I ended up staying away from the pork items which had a weird smell to it and stuck with shrimp items.

"I love University Avenue. I love its vibe, I love its scenery, and it has so many food places! So why... Why in the world... would you choose Lemonade?

To be honest, I've always been appealed to Lemonade's cute branding and I expected a lunch with delicious, yet healthy, filling food. Instead, the food was bland, the service was incompetent, and honestly... it was a sad, sad lunch experience.

I got a ""poke bowl"" for $14. Aka, 2 spoonfuls of fish, super salty furikake, and half-cooked brown rice. The rice was a textural experience. It was somewhere between mushy chowder and crispy grains. It was having an identity crisis. Rice is supposed to be rice, but the carb creation that accompanied my fish was just confusing. As for the poke toppings, I didn't know whether or not to slide down to the cashier after receiving my bowl because I literally had to ask them, ""That's it?"" I was waiting for $14 worth of food. Actually, adjusted for Palo Alto's prices, I was waiting for $9 worth of food. Instead, I got a big, flat bowl of mushy brown rice and some silvers of fish and toppings. The flavor was so unappealing that I tried to eat more furikake, which is meant to be a seasoning of seaweed, sesame seeds, salt, sugar, dried fish, and perhaps MSG. Instead, it was salt and sugar, with a little bit of seaweed and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. 

To yuck more of my yum, I feel like the staff were so poorly trained. I had to call for someone to order myself when we were the only ones in the store and they stood around talking to each other. Furthermore, my cousin ordered a chicken sandwich that took half an hour to come out. The server couldn't find our table and left the food on the counter. My cousin had to go to the register herself, and when she did, the sandwich was being passed around. It wasn't until I saw an employee walking around with a sandwich that I had to stop them and ask for its name. 

Was the sandwich worth the wait? If we were given cardboard to eat, I don't think we could've told the difference. There was a complete lack of seasoning, the bread was cold and tough, and it felt like it overall came straight from being in a fridge for a few hours. Cue the sadness on our faces when we realized Onigilly was located across the street and we should've gone there.

Finally, at least let the namesake of the restaurant be good. I used my Yelp check-in for a free lemonade. The purple flavor didn't appeal to me after I tried a sample, so I went with the safe option: the classic. It tasted like someone squeezed a cup of lemon juice and dumped a cup of sugar in it. It felt like I was burning my tongue with acid and getting a cavity at the same time. I really hope this was a one-time occurrence for the day I went.

"UPDATE 04-04-2018
In their feeble quest to satisfy their shortcomings I have been invited to not return LOL

""I hope you see my public message. Do not come to my Deli again."" Vicky M - Mar 26 2018

As in the past I will use this direct interaction to adjust the deserved and earned rating. Last time up a star. This time down a star. 

Based on the owner's disdain for their paying customers I am surprised anybody tolerates their ineptitude, poor service and flippant attitude. 

My newest complaint revolves around their slow witted perception of reality. Vicky you obviously read my review, based on your offer to not return. Did you ""think"" I was coming back?! LOL no effing chance lady. 

UPDATE 07-01-2017

So it was a bad past experience and I said i probably wouldn't be back. 

Fast forward a short 2 1/2 years and thought i would roll the dice again. That's right, this place is a gamble. 

I arrive slightly before what i would call their lunch rush. Two parties at two different tables and four people in line ahead of me. Not that busy. 

While waiting others arrive in line behind me. Although physically behind me they are actually placed at the head of the line, by name. I assume these folks are the ""regulars"". Neat. When a regular shows up the line you are waiting in stops. They are served. You wait. This happened three times while i was ""in line"". So that four people ahead of me was actually seven. Neat. 

Your order is taken. You are asked to repeat items as the little red headed lady is rather forgetful. 

They again ask if it's to go or for here. Again she seems rather forgetful. Maybe her handwriting is just bad? 

I wouldn't get anything to go without double checking it upon pick up. 

Some how their efforts continue to be misguided as four people that came in after me and actually waited in line left before me. Nothing fancy. Just a sandwich off their menu. 

From time i entered shop until time i left with food in hand: 19 minutes!

One sandwich, 19 minutes!! Luckily I didn't go crazy and get a bag of chips also. May vary well still be waiting. 

THE SERVICE IS THAT POOR! 

As for the food itself, my ""hot"" sandwich was served cold. The flavor was fine, just cold. 

The ingredients, as reviewed in the past, seem very fresh. The food however suffers as staff struggle to keep up. 

Overall this place is an easy ""don't bother"" with their combination of poor service, out of way location, and bad business ethics. 

The service level just doesn't meet their expensive pricing structure, leaving little value in the offered food. 

Once again, I probably won't be back.

Came here for lunch. Why have the new lady work the register. Big mistake. 

Didn't know price of sandwich. LOL it's a sandwich shop. 

Didn't know price of drink either. 

Maybe they don't sell many drinks with their sandwiches due to cost...?! 

One sandwich two drinks right at $19.00!! 

Probably won't be back based just on that. 

Located in industrial park. Kinda out of the way. Close to some businesses if you work in that part of town. 

Next to highway. Kind of noisy. 

Six tables inside. Two tables outside. Pretty small. The big mouthed chick three feet away is really easy to hear. Unfortunately. 

All ingredients seemed very fresh. Sandwich was awesome. For the money that makes sense. When you order a sandwich that's it. It doesn't come with fries, chips, slaw, etc...

When they say they have beer and wine what they mean is that they have one wine and one beer type. Your choice is ""do you want it, yes or no"" LOL

The server we had that day was apparently her first day. After taking our order, I asked her where the bathroom was and she had no idea. I had to wait for her to flag another employee to ask again where. A dish was laid on our table, which I did not recognize. I quickly went back to the menu, and pointed out the ingredients which were missing from the dish to the server. She rolled her eyes and took the dish back to the kitchen. It took about half an hour for the right dish to make it back to our table. Our constantly empty water cups were largely ignored by the wait staff. The Jungle Beef, which I read rave reviews about, was extremely salty and impossible to eat. It was so disgusting! The meat was also pretty overcooked and so chewy that I found it hard to swallow. 

I flagged another server for the bill (since my original server, the new one, had mysteriously disappeared and stopped going by our table), and we were charged for the incorrect dish! I had to ask for the bill to be remade again and was very annoyed.

"Ordered take out from this place. I was super excited because the reviews for this place were good. I ordered the popular spicy dumplings in addition to two orders of Xiao long baos.

I thought that the packaging was just fine. Most places just dump the dumplings in a container but Village House put in a piece of cabbage underneath all the dumplings. I'm assuming it's so it doesn't stick to the plastic, but I thought that it was a nice touch.

What I wasn't pleased about were the holes in the dumplings. I thought Xiao long baos were supposed to have soup preserved in them from steaming them? All of the dumplings (yes. All of the dumplings I ordered in BOTH orders) had holes in them. There was no soup to be found in any of the dumplings. I was severely disappointed. Needless to say I will not be ordering from here ever again. I looked through some other reviews and it seems that other people had the same problem as well. Do they do this on purpose?

The dumpling skin was thick & chewy, which isn't something that I'm used to. The spicy dumplings were just okay. They were coated in thick oil that wasn't spicy... so it was basically oil, some pieces of garlic, and the dumplings being marinated in all the oil.

"Let me qualify this by saying that I grew up on Carolina BBQ, and I've visited some of the most renowned places in the country (Rochester, Austin, Memphis, San Diego, etc.).

I would consider a $25 two meat plate a little steep, compared to say Stay Gold. The quantity of food is decent, but several of the items were just weird. The pulled pork didn't seem very wet in the sense that the main flavor seemed to come from the BBQ sauce slathered all over it. The pork ribs were VERY dry, the coleslaw was watery and has zero mayo in it (I'm not sure if that's part of their dietary restriction play), and the corn bread was probably the worst I've had in a long time - super dry and flavorless.

For the price you pay, you expect full service. All you get is a buzzer and you get your food yourself at the pickup window. Water is self-served as well.

Which brings me to the weird layout. You order your drinks from the bar on the right side, but you order food in the center. Then you pick up you own food from the behind the bar on the right side. It's a large space, just confusing and not well thought out.

I appreciate this place is a Berkeley staple, but it wouldn't cut it with real BBQ aficionados. I think I'll stick with my east bay favorites - Sauced and Slow Hand.",2,0,0,0,0

"tl;dr - Overpriced and overated

I must have driven by Parada countless times with a mental note to try the Peruvian restaurant one day. Well, this past weekend, I finally decided to give it a try. In hindsight, I see why curiosity killed the gato... and honestly, I should've kept driving. You see, Parada was no bueno. 

While the interior is modern and trendy and gives it that hipster vibe with an open kitchen, a bar, and beautifully decorated murals of the motherland, the food wasn't as nice as the d�����cor. For me, taste is more important than the aesthetics. Moreover, as I looked over the menu, I could tell that this place was priced for the gringos of Walnut Creek. Pretty much any entr�����e is $20+. Also, there is no Happy Hour. ����Qu����� l�����stima! 

The wife and I ended up ordering a Beef Lomo Saltado ($24.50), the Cebiche Mixto ($22.50), and a Peruvian Beer ($7). The server up-sold us by asking if we wanted chips with the cebiche, so we blindly sai.50 for a small bowl. ����Ay, caramba!

The Lomo Saltado tasted more like stew than a stir fry and the entire dish felt like it was not in unison. Also, the flavors were overpowered by a tad too much cumin. Maybe I am biased, but I prefer the lomo saltado that has more of a soy sauce flavor since the dish was invented by Asian immigrants to Peru. And, they really do ""salt"" part right in the lomo SALTado because it was wayyyyyy too salty. We had to order extra rice just to finish it. Again, the server did not tell us about the upcharge for extra rice ($4). ����No mames!

Let me pause here and say when you charge $4 for a bowl of plain rice, this is where you piss me off. As an Asian man I know how easy it is to make rice and it never should cost $4. ����NUNCA!. Especially when Parada charges a side of bread $3.50. 

While the flavors of the cebiche mixto were good, I don't think the two pieces of clam, the two pieces of mussels, and the single shrimp make it a true cebiche mixto. If you do come here, just get the regular cebiche since they do give you a lot of fish. 

At the end of the day, I've had better Peruvian and so I ca""Meh, I've experienced better"". I still can't get over the cost of an extra bowl of rice.",2,17,21,19,0

I was up crying in the bathroom until midnight! With one whole day of being miserable I thought it was over..until the next morning. Again, more tears and on the verge on going to the E.R! Everything that came up was the color and smell of the mango drink. HORRIBLE!! I honestly believe it was the bbq chicken and the mango drink.

The employee who seemed tasked with the responsibility to hand over the orders occupied herself with other duties while prepared food sat.

"Oh man, where do I start...? So first thing first, you don't get a menu. We sat down, not sure what to do. Then we saw a food bar with ""Order Here"". So alright, I guess we go there and order food (as well as looking at Yelp reviews) The waiter just sat us down and didn't even tell us what to do. So if this is your first time, I'll break it down for you: you get seated, you walk to the front of the place and order whatever they have on display, and sit back down because the waiter will bring your ordered food to you. And then you go back to the front of the place to pay (it's cash only). They say each plate is $6.00/$7.00, but they don't display the prices on the food plates, so you won't know how much each plate is. AND you don't get a receipt after you pay. So you could be ripped off for all I know. Now, here comes the food part. The porridge wasn't even that good. My mom makes better porridge than they do. Or even dim sum places make better porridge. It was just not flavorful. They literally just add sweet potato and that's it. I don't know if they change food here and there. But I came during Sunday lunch time, and the food sucked. The plate is so SMALL, like not worth the price. I rather visit another place that's a bit more expensive and worth the price. The food had no flavor, dull, and small plates. Our total was over $50.00 for like 6 small plates. If it was good, then it would've been worth it. But it's like...bland. The service here wasn't all that great either, no instructions on how to order and pretty much had no interaction with them since they don't ever come to your table after placing your food. 

Recommendation(s):
- Nothing

Service: 1/5

Tip(s):
- Cash only
- You get seated, go up to the front and order food (each plate is supposedly $6.00/$7.00 -- but no price tags on the food items), you go back to your table because they bring the food out to you, then you go up to the front to pay

"$60 + 6% for god damn roasted chicken and leaves. If I could give 0/5 this would be my first.

This restaurant is the a epitome of San Francisco nonsense. You wait a full hour to literally eat $60 completely normal roasted chicken - and the hipsters die over it. 

It is literally about as tasty as the Costco rotisserie chicken. Except I could buy 12 at Costco for the same price and get a sample of 4-grain cracker and roasted tomato hummus. 

Other than the chicken, I ate some 10 day old stale wheat bread with butter and overpriced polenta with cheese. Then went home and ate some Ben n Jerry's to revive my taste buds.

This used to be my favorite place and I went there regularly. Last night I had the worst experience I've ever had in a SF restaurant. Never again. Won't go back. 

The bartender was openly rude. Sabotaged our drink orders. He is the main issue here. A horrible man. Unhelpful. In need of a shower. Clearly he was stoned and overworked. Just nasty. I waited 49 minutes and never got my beer with dinner. The beers that did come out with four inches of foam and two inches of beer. What an insult. They tasted awful. Not at all what we ordered. The bottles of beer then made their way out at the hour mark. Warm. Undrinkable. 

The burger used to be the best in town. They now tasted cheap and watery. The mussels to replace them were dry and tasteless. 

The waiter was helpless and blamed the bartender was an awful person. When I asked to speak to the manager, the waiter pointed to the bartender. He was the manager. Just awful.

"One of the pros of this spot is the Yelp waitlist. I joined the waitlist before I arrived, since I knew that this restaurant always has a long wait. I got seated around 5:55pm, and the waitress came along around 6:01. I asked her if I could redeem my free egg from the Yelp check-in that I retrieved around 5:58. She declined which made me super annoyed. Like if she had come sooner I would've been able to use it. That left a sour taste in my mouth right in the beginning. 

The ramen came out pretty quickly, but it was a disappointment. The portions were not as big as other ramen shops in SF, and it was so expensive for what it was. I ordered the spicy miso chicken ramen, and there was almost no chicken. Just a few scraps of chicken skin. 

Another con was the lack of AC. It was pretty hot that day for SF, around 75 degrees, and the establishment did not turn on their AC (or I don't even know if they have AC). 

Lastly, my friend and I wanted to use two cards to split the check but our waitress didn't understand our request. Another waitress had to step in and take our bill in the end. You'd think that a popular restaurant would be a bit more competent. 

Definitely will not be returning. There are an abundance of other ramen shops in SF to choose from.",2,0,2,0,0

"Same as a few of the other reviews, we walked in on the worst possible night. 

Short story: 7pm reservation for 7. Seated at 7:45. Got our water at 8:05. One Sangria came at 8:30. Lady came by with an unapologetic reason at 8:40. We walked out at 8:45.

Long story: As we waited, I was on my phone outside. I noticed a couple of tables that were served only water. Few minutes later, they walked out. 

But we're having a gathering of friends I don't see often, so we waited and were finally seated at 7:45. No one came by to say hi, they'll be right with us, or offered any explanation, basically just ignored us. We had to flag down a lady to say we're ready to order, in which I heard her say, ""oh do you want your server?"" Not the best question but yes ... we want our server. 

We asked for water. Young lady came by with a small bottle for 7 people. After filling 3 glasses, the bottle was empty. She had to go back and get another bottle. Efficient? No. Perhaps grab 3 bottles and leave it with us would've saved her 2 trips. 

We had to ask for napkins from a young man who I spotted later wiping glasses in the back. It's not his fault. He obviously was given no direction on how he can help where it was needed, either in the kitchen or in the dining room floor. 

There was no manager visible walking through the crowds greeting diners and explaining anything. Just servers that looked beaten and exhausted. 

After more than 1/2 hour, the Sangria finally came out. But no appetizers or dishes were to be seen. 1.5 hours after our reservation, we had water and one drink. 

The same young lady who brought the water came by at 8:40 and said everyone came at the same time, and I heard that repeated at other tables too. I wonder ... Friday evening during dinner hours at an area known for restaurants, what did they expect to happen? 

We tried to be patient up until we were told in a nonchalant tone that we can either stay or leave. No sorry, can I bring you some drinks on the house? No I'll comp your appetizer for the extremely long wait. Just .. you can leave. We weren't the only table to leave. We just followed the others out. 

The decor and vibe is nice, and I wanted to enjoy this restaurant. But for obvious reasons, we didn't have the chance to. If you want to try them, I advise you to wait a month to make sure they straighten things out and properly train the staff to be more efficient, more personable under pressure, and work the crowd to make them at least feel a little welcomed, all of which we didn't experience.",1,18,36,22,0
"I moved to South Bay Area only for one year, and I have been to this place multiple times, had good impression before. So when my friends are visiting me from Canada (also her birthday), we decide to celebrate at this place. So we called to make a reservation yesterday.

But the reservation does not work. We made a reservation at 5:30 today, and told them we might be a little bit late. They said no worries and they will keep the sit till 5:45pm. Today during the day time, my friends called and want to move the reservation to 6:00pm. We called multiple times, but nobody is answering the phone. 
Anyway, so we arrived at 5:40 pm

When we arrived, nobody is serving us. They just let us stand there for 30 minutes and keep rolling eyes eyes on us. We have to went up and catch one staff to communicated but she told us: you are already cancel the reservation. I was like wtf? No body is answering the phone call and how we can cancel it? They said because we are late. Lol they said they will keep the sit until 5:45pm and right now 5:40 and we are been cancelled?

"Cheesecake Factory.... man. I'm constantly underwhelmed and last night was not an exception. 

The wait times were incredibly long last night. That is not an issue for me because I know and understand how busy and packed this place gets. Everyone who works there is on the move and doing their job quickly and with purpose. We were told it was going to be 35 minutes but it took around 50-55 minutes to be seated. 

My really issue from last night is with the food!! The whole reason I even go to this place! I got the skinnylicious shrimp tacos and honestly the shrimp was a day or two old at least. It did not have a shrimp texture and was hard and rubbery. It definitely had reheated days old shrimp energy. I feel like also they reduced the portions significantly. My sister got the orange chicken with brown rice and that portion was cut in half to what it used to be. The prices are still the same outrageous prices so why did the quality and quantity go down?? Is it because Cheesecake Factory knows a lot of people will come anyway so they don't need to try to serve actually good quality food with portions that are on par with the prices they are charging? I'm just curious. 

I was underwhelmed and grossed out honestly by my experience at Cheesecake Factory last night. I only gave my review 2 stars for the hard working staff that were running around to get everyone seated and served.",2,1,2,1,0

Food was mediocre at best - the only good thing was the pupusa.

"This place is a tourist trap and the food ranges from mediocre to not good at all. It is also extremely overpriced. I have been here three times over the last few years when out of town co-workers visit in large groups. The pasta is always overcooked and the sauces are uninviting. The steak and fish is bland and you get a giant piece of undercooked broccoli as a side. There is nothing authentic Tuscan on the menu even though it's claiming to be a Tuscan Italian restaurant. They even have pictures of Venice on the walls.

I would never choose to eat here and hope you do not either. The choices for Italian food in San Francisco are abundant and North Beach Restaurant should not be on the list. This is the same review I left on Google to ensure it is heard.",1,0,0,0,0

"Tonight was our second time coming here and thought maybe it was a fluke when the first time we came was bad service and meh food. Well unfortunately if I could give a 1/2 star I would. The greeting was nice but once our order was taken and dropped off we never saw the server again. We both needed refills on our drinks but they never came back to ask if everything was alright. We had to get up and go to the podium to pay for our food. Then as we were eating a couple was seated next to us and they were never helped for well over 5 minutes. So I don't blame them for walking out. Also to add to the meh food.. it's pricey for the portions you receive. Disappointing!

I went for a fried tomato sanwhich instead, and I asked them to have the sauce on the side, because I couldn't eat it right away, at least not until my lunch time which was about 2 hrs later. The sanwhich by itself was like 9 buc, add avocado for 3 buc, so the total was around 14 dollar for a veggie sanwhich so it was not cheap. The sauce that they gave was some really citricy aioli sauce. I thought the sanwhich was a bit greasy because they toasted the bread with oil, it didn't taste interesting or anything, nothing special. Would not come back for sure.

"I'm posting this review to let you know - Be careful with the RAW OYSTERS here!!!

My husband and I had lunch here today, and he ate some raw oysters during the lunch. After lunch he felt tired so he took a nap (around 30mins) in the car. Then, he started feeling cold and sweating, numbness and a terrible stomach-ache. After he vomited twice, we realized he might has got food poisoning. So we went to ER. I was so scared by his symptoms. 

Right now we are still at the ER, fortunately he's getting better now. I think I should have given the restaurant a call to make sure the oysters are good so no one else gets sick.

Then the food runner who brought out our food brought the order made incorrectly started to roll his eyes at us and insisting that we were wrong, which put things over the top. The server corrected him and he again rolled his eyes and quickly left our table. 

Overall, the tea leaf salad was really good. The other dishes were too saucy and not memorable. We also felt they were overpriced for the food that was being served and esp the poor service. Needless to say, probably will not be back to try it again and lesson learned to try out new places before bringing our friends/family.

"Came here with a few of my friends to celebrate my birthday. We've been to Goku for AYCE hot pot numerous times and had a good experience so I decided on this restaurant. This one really tainted all of my positive experiences. 

We were served by Meixin (Joanna) and she didn't crack a smile when greeting us - not even once. I figured she was having a rough day so we proceeded to pass the order sheet around so that we can get our dinner started. One by one, ingredients came out. When we noticed that there were multiple things that were missing (after waiting for 15+ mins), we figured it was no big deal and marked it again. It still didn't come out halfway through our meal so I decided to flag her down and ask for it. 

She gave us no explanation for the missing food. I just wanted to know if they were out of the ingredients or if she forgot them. Sure enough, it came out a few seconds later and that's how I figured out that she probably forgot them. The restaurant was half full and given that I was a server myself, all through my college years, I thought it was pretty odd that the server couldn't handle the tables. 

She probably checked up on us a total of three times during our 90 minute meal there. 1) to greet us 2) when we wanted to order our soju 3) to ask if we want more water. Not to mention that when my friend let her know it was my birthday, she didn't even look my way or wish me a happy birthday. It just made me feel uncomfortable and unwanted at the restaurant. 

Despite my negative experience with her service, I still tipped her because I understand that being a server is not an easy job. But Joanna, if you are reading this, maybe if you smiled a bit more and actually looked like you were enjoying your job, your guests will also feel comfortable. Just a thought. And thank you Jasmine for helping us check out so that we don't have to sit at our table waiting for Joanna to pick up the check.

"Food: delicious
Attitude: STINKS!
Have dined there quite a bit in 5 yrs, mostly to go orders. Never a complaint. Recently, ordered a sandwich, ate it as I drove home a few minutes away. More than halfway through the sandwich I found a long black hair, stuck, sitting underneath the sandwich . I immediately drove back (never having gotten out of my car at home). The older man in back (I presume, the owner) was very upset that I'd found the hair. He clearly couldn't blame me I'm blond). He asked where I found it precisely. He points to his nearly bald head and says""clearly it's not mine, I have no hair."" Nevermind the only other person who works there is the lady with the long black hair is standing right next to him ringing up a customer . I said ""no, you don't have hair but she does."" He says ""but I'm the only one who uses the grill, she doesn't make the sandwiches."" Blatant lie. That lady spends most of her time back there, as you have to stand there waiting to place your order because she's in back preparing orders. She doesn't wear a hairnet (cap only), which doesn't keep hair from getting into the food unfortunately. I was actually going to request another sandwich but before I could do that he knew this was legit and aggressively says, "" ok I give your money back,"" as he grabs the container and storms away to the kitchen! I really didn't expect this pouty child- like behavior. What did I expect? For him to say, "" I'm sorry this happened. Would you like a refund or can I offer you another sandwich?"" Anything other than his reaction. Geeezzz, how do you get mad at the customer for something that's clearly Your fault? People are so weird. Own your mistakes, apologize and move on! It's not that hard. But then again, it must be easier to pretend it's not your fault and blame the customer . Terrible business practice!!!",1,2,0,0,0
"I've been here twice and I hate to say this because the fish is good, but the level of rudeness of the chef is enough to make me unlikely to ever go back, even though it's about a 5 minute drive from my home.

I went with my parents and my boyfriend. We ordered Omakase, which was 12 pieces of nigiri. It took 3 hours to get all our food. That would have been ok if he was even explaining the food, but we spent most of the night hungrily sitting and staring at him giving food to the 2 other people in the restaurant and completely ignoring us. He only seats 6 people at a time, so there is absolutely no reason for this.

The worst part is that he kept belittling and insulting my 70 year-old father, criticizing how he was eating his sushi (mind you he has spent significant time in Japan), telling him he was ""rough but fortunately has time to grow"" because he's ""young"" (then repeatedly laughing about that comment) with no exaggeration at least 10 times. At certain points my mom would want to share a bite of her food with my dad, and the chef would aggressively insist ""no don't give him any."" I was completely infuriated that he would treat my dad like this, who sat there politely throughout this horrendous, belittling treatment. Especially when paying $60+ for a meal, I expect to be treated with some common respect.

Additionally, both times we went the chef spent the whole dinner telling us how expensive his fish was, how everything was ""the best in the world,"" how his customers ""are classy"" so they don't mind paying. Elitist, rude, and forgetting that we live in a place with MANY excellent sushi options.",2,4,10,1,0
"Beware! Years ago Tsing Tao had tasty Chinese food, but something has changed. The other day I placed a takeout order for egg roles, fried rice, and chow main. The total cost was a little over $30, and I feel liked I was ripped off. I can honestly say I have never had any Chinese food that was so tasteless. 

When I opened the fried rice, I immediately noticed something was wrong. The dish was bright white instead of the normal brownish tint. Long story short, they simply dumped some steamed rice along with a scrambled egg and some peas to make the dish. This is not the way anyone makes fried rice, and I am still a little surprised. The chow main was equally suspicious and the noodles tasted doughy and undercooked. The egg rolls were so-so we ate some. Nobody had more than a few bites of the main dishes, and the vote was to trash the rest.

I would normally reach out to a business after a bad experience, but I do not feel that this restaurant would really care. Instead of Tsing Tao, my advice is to pick another restaurant or stop at Safeway and pick-up a frozen PF Chang entree and some white rice. The food will taste a lot better.",1,0,1,0,0
"We come here almost every weekend for brunch and the food is fantastic. Why the 2 stars? Because although the food is 5 stars, every weekend we're greeted by a miserable hostess at the front. MISERABLE. You'll recognize her. She has curly hair, never smiles, and is usually at the host stand texting or looking like this is the worst day of her life. She's unpleasant and clearly hates her job. In the past, she has always been the one part of our visit that we dread because she is just so rude. 

This most recent visit we finally decided we had to find a new brunch spot because she is unbearable. Walk in and she's texting on her phone (as usual) at the host stand. Ignores me for a few more moments then just looks up at me. No hello. Nothing. She started by having me seat myself. Just handed me menus and pointed me towards the bar. I asked if we could have a table and she said no. No explanation. No waitlist for a seated table. Just no. Okay.... so now she's graced me with one word since I've arrived. ""No.""

So I hop on opentable and there are reservations available in 5 mins and 20 mins!!! Tempted to make a reservation but we decide not to so we don't have to engage with her anymore.The 8 available tables that were there when we walked in remained open the entire time until we left. 


Same hostess brings us our food and literally doesn't say a word and leaves all of our old dirty dishes in front of us. Since we were at the bar she just dropped them at the seats around us versus making space for us to have our food in front of us. Before we can even ask her for more water, ketchup or to take our dishes, she walks away.

"If you're into one seasoning fits all...this is totally your spot. Totally not trying to knock on this place but I just wasn't feeling the dry chili rub on everything. 

Let's start with the positives. It's open late night! That's huge! We had just come from a concert in the East Bay and were aiming for an AYCE-BBQ spot but at 11pm, all our go to's were closed. Our phones were all dead so when we saw an ""open"" sign in front of Aceking, we went for it.

It's also a keto-friendly spot. With meats on a stick, you can't go wrong. That is, unless you don't know if Sheep Testis or Backstrops of bull is higher in fat (for the keto) or in protein. Without our trusty Yelp app, we didn't know what to order so we left it up to my husband to order. I think he stayed on the safe side and ordered chicken, beef, pork skin, and shrimp. When kabobs were being dropped onto our community plate, we didn't know what was being delivered. Texture was tough and it all tasted the same. 

We ordered mushrooms and eggplant. The texture of the grilled eggplant was perfect and the dry chili rub happened to work well with it. I think I should have just ordered hella eggplant and called it a night. 

We also ordered Doughboy soup which came out a good 15 minutes after we were done with the kabobs. I think the waiter said there was egg in it. But I'm pretty sure there were some non-egg pieces. Regardless of what was in it, the soup was pretty tasty. It reminded me of egg drop soup minus everything you normally see in egg drop and add little white mysterious pieces. We were so hungry, we ate it all.

"Mixed bag here. One problem with Fremont dining is there is little competition in fine-dining and restaurants in general so places stagnate. For what we spent here, upwards of $150 with tip, it needs improvements. 

Service in general was pretty good. It was hot as hell outside and AC inside not quite keeping up. 

Main problem was the main dishes. I ordered Dover Sole for like $26 expecting a nice piece of fish. But they breaded it and drowned it with heavy sauce. Why? You don't hide a good piece of fish. I hunted around in it and found some nice bites.

Wife ordered beef short ribs. She said she could only eat about half of it because meat was just so fatty. That was about $32.

Brussels sprouts were also drowned in a heavy sauce. You don't need to go this heavy on the sauces.

Drinks were good, especially the martini. I had a beet salad that was good. 

Odd thing was a waiter saw that I had a dirty knife on one dish, remarked about it and just told me to keep it. That's strange. How about just replace it without comment? They were nice enough to fix our tippy taple, but the waiter ""tested"" it while we each obviously had a full martini on the table. Guess what? Shocker, partially spilled martini.

The chicken picatta was also over cooked having a texture of leather with oil sauce.,1,0,1,0,0
"I'd been to this restaurant three times previously and really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly, service was quick, and the food was good. The fourth time, however, was not a good experience. We walked in, went to the counter to order, and were ignored. When we finally we greeted, I realized that cool vibe had gone. All the employees really did not want to be there, were not friendly, and were more interested in interacting with each other than the customers. The food was good, but portions are much smaller than previously, but the prices remained the same. I would just say to the owner, train your staff better, let go those that don't get it, and never forget your staff is the face of your business. If they don't care, then we think you don't either.",2,0,3,0,0
"Came here when we were visiting the greater San Jose area and it was a miss. Typically we enjoy Kickin' Crabs but it was sub par. 

When we walked in we should have realized that something was off... no hostess/host and hardly anyone eating in the restaurant. 

We ordered the edamame for appetizer and it was so so so spicy I could not even eat it (and I love spice!) Our server offered garlic sauce for the spice but it never made it to our table. The crab legs, sausage, and shrimp were wayyy less spicy and we ordered them the same caliber as the edamame (everything was ordered our usual way!) My favorite was the snow crab yay!

Anyway, something that struck me as odd-- I accidentally knocked our edamame shells and some seafood shells on to the floor and they flung in to the walk way (totally an accident). Multiple employees stepped right over it or in it. Keep in mind this is not an appetizing sight to see on the floor. Another bystander diner couldn't believe the amount of employees ignoring it for 15 minutes (not exaggerating). Finally he spoke up and said isn't anyone going to clean that up! Finally someone came with a roll of paper towels and stated that they don't have a broom. 

After this we decided to ask for a bucket or something to put our shells in because it was getting very very messy on the table and hard to tell what was eaten and what was not. The server said that they have no such thing and that we should leave our shells on the table.... hmmmmmmmmm I won't be back.",2,2,7,3,0
"I've never had to write a bad review about service until today .. we attended the Lafayette Art and wine festival last night and had dinner. We asked for a round of beers and literally it took 15 min to get to our table and when delivered, they went to the wrong people and the wrong type of beer. 

Perhaps that was just a small mix up, but when the food arrived , it came late and the food orders got mixed up to the wrong people on the table ....when we requested additional beers they arrived 10 min later and the wrong type of beers again 

Lastly when I asked the host where my Paella was 30 min after I ordered it , she said she forgot, and her explanation was ""she's been working all day"", then the waitress offered to make it to go..... ! 

I thought we were being singled out because there were too many things going wrong with our orders, but the customers across our table had the same experience! So our party of 9 was done and over with this place ..",1,1,2,0,0
"The last few times my husband and I ate here (we're locals), the service was good, the bartenders and servers were very nice but the food was absolutely awful. Husband ordered French Onion soup at the upper bar and the soup's flavor wasn't rich and onion-y, it was more beef-stock forward (onions weren't caramelized) and there was nary a shred of cheese on top. If you're charging $13 for French Onion Soup, for goodness sake - put some proper Greyere cheese on top. We also ordered White Gulf Shrimp Tempura and received four shrimp and a few slices of pickled cucumber, for $18 dollars. Good thing I wasn't hungry. 

O_o (this is my ""I'm giving you the stink eye look).

This evening (10/4), hubby and I ate at the Sutro, he ordered the burger and I ordered a NY Strip and I swear to god my steak was tougher than boot leather. I had to send it back. The hubby ordered a hamburger medium rare and it came well-done and it was falling apart. I don't know if the bun was stale or not but it completely disintegrated. 
Our server kindly took my steak off the bill and I tipped him well - but if you are looking for a nice steak, go somewhere else like Alfred's, Ruth Chris', or the Brazen Head in the Marina.

"Pho#1 wasn't #1 for me..
I feel like I've been here before and it was okay but my most recent experience was very meh. 
Two friends and I ordered our pho. Two times the servers tried to give us the wrong order. Finally we got our orders, except one of my friends got the wrong order, again. He started eating it because he didn't know until he had a bite that all the protein options he ordered wasn't there. When we told the servers, they took it away and brought back the correct order. But on top of that I just didn't really enjoy the taste of the broth.. Can't really pinpoint what about it but it didn't satisfy my pho cravings. The broth was a little too oily. I usually like to eat the noodles with the broth but I just couldn't. 
However, the portion size is great! I got the small and my friend got the large, but my small looked pretty large too.",2,1,1,1,0
"This has been the worse experience at a BWW I've ever had. 

We enter only to wait on a host/hostess for 10-15 minutes. We were told that all he had to do was clean a table off. He went off to clean the table only to seat another party. At this time another hostess comes by and asks how many in our party. A little frustrated we say 5 and that we couldn't wait too long so they clean off another table and seat us. 

The moment I sat down there was something disgusting on the seat. When they wipe off tables they disregard the seats. I had them clean it off once more. 

Already a little discussed with our experience we proceed to order food. After 30 minutes they finally come with the wrong order. We found that we got another tables order and they got ours. 

We saw that table touch our food and say ""this isn't ours."" to the waitress. This where I was PISSED. The waitress grabbed the food off their table and tried to serve it to us. Obviously we asked them to remake the food because we were comfortable with eating food that others have touched. 

Another 10 minutes they said. While we waited our ultimate nachos were served COLD with a tiny bit of toppings! We asked them to remake the nachos too. They agreed with eyes rolling.

That was the last straw. We asked them to forget about making it and that we were leaving. The manager comes out to try to talk to us and make things better.

We reply saying ""sorry were don't feel like eating here and more"". And we get a rude response ""Well don't eat here then!"" Shocked, we just stormed off.


If you want shitty service, terrible quality food, long waits and no common sense this is the perfect place for you! All you normal folks PLEASE AVOID this sad excuse of a restaurant.

"I was at the Boat House for a reunion many years ago, and we went to Jack London for food. I remember wishing that there was something more local that could host a lot of people and had this been around, this would have been the spot. Unfortunately, their food is kinda crappy. Now, this place is beautiful inside. And both times I went, it was sunny enough to eat outside, but it reminds me of a bar called Shakespeare that I visited in London. It looked like it was a cool spot to hang out for a drink and turned out to be an overblown waste of time. Ditto with this place.

I went with some family members and we ordered something and it was OK. I think I ate off people's plates. The food was prices, the drinks were OK and I was underwhelmed (clean bathrooms though). I went back for a taco Tuesday and they claimed to have street tacos. And they were, but I couldn't distinguish between the different tacos. They all tasted the same. They looked beautiful, but the flavor was the same for all of them. And I know a street taco. And my husband makes a mean one. If they couldn't do that properly, it didn't matter how cheap they were to me. The drink, again, was OK.

Although I miss it, I'm glad that a new shop opened to replace it because there hasn't been an occupancy for awhile. 

Now on to the review of the food. I was happy to see a place that served fast food takoyaki. It reminded me of my travel to Japan! I would eat these little suckers with a stick while strolling the streets in Osaka. Unfortunately, yama-chan's takoyaki. didn't taste the same as the ones in Japan. Firstly, it was soaked in yuzu and some watered down mayo. Secondly, there were a Sh*t ton of green onions and the Takoyaki had one rubbery 1 inch piece of octopus that I pushed to the side. To put things to perspective. Imagine eating a taco with HELLA fajita mix and one tiny piece of carne asada. You would be disappointed.

"I've been to a few BWW's and this one's been the worst experience as far as customer service goes.

The hostess brought our party of 7 to our table right as we walked in, but no contact with any employee for another 20 minutes. GABRIELLE was working our section and avoided all eye contact with us - didn't even introduce herself. We were told that she was too busy to serve us but we definitely saw her either chatting with the other servers or just texting on her phone for the entire duration of our dinner.

Another 10 min pass and finally, Franklin asked us if we'd been helped. He looked around and when he couldn't get our actual server to do her damn job, he decided to just help us himself. Service was slow, but at this point we were just glad we were being given the correct food and drinks (from the moment we sat down, it took over an hour to get our drinks and cocktails, and another 15 min after that to get our food).

A huge thanks to Franklin at the very least for being kind and patient enough to take care of our table but the rest of the staff here, ESPECIALLY the girl who was supposed to serve us, was extremely disappointing.

"I really dislike leaving bad yelp reviews, but I think today earned this negative review. I've been here several times since I was a kid and typically haven't had anything negative to say until now. 

Firstly, my boyfriend is currently vomiting with food poisoning from lunch....so we will start with that. Upon entering today, there was nobody in the front to seat waiting customers. We waited for 10 min before actually walking back to the seating portion of the restaurant and practically seating ourselves - that should've been our first sign to leave. (The restaurant only had 2 other customers so no excuse to not have someone at the front; especially after waiting 10+ minutes) 

We were seated outside, and our drink orders were taken but the server had a very difficult time understanding our order. (Melon margarita and a VIRGIN mojito as our friend is pregnant) the server took the order, came back twice to confirm he wrote the correct thing down. Shortly after someone else came and re-took our drink orders. Luckily they didn't mistake the Virgin drink but we asked for a blended pitcher and came out with what seemed like margarita in the rocks with melted ice? To be honest I'm not sure but it was probably one of the most disgusting margaritas I've ever had. I expected it to be orange or pink as it was ""melon"" flavor but came out bright green...we didn't let that stop us from drinking it until we tasted how disgusting it was and how it wasn't blended like we had asked. It would've been nice to have gotten that correct as the pitchers are practically $50! 

The food itself was mediocre. Definitely nothing special. My boyfriend ate about half his plate before he started feeling sick and had to actually go and sit in the car laying down for the remainder of lunch. By the time what home we didn't even make it to the driveway before he started vomiting up his lunch. 

I honestly didn't even bother calling to complain cause I'll honestly NEVER be returning here again! Service was horrible from the time we walked in, food sucked and drinks were even worse.

2) Tom ka soup - The broth was too creamy that we felt it's like cream chowder or something. Too thick. Couldn't finish either.

3) Fried calamari - calamari themselves are so skinny, you can just tell it is from the bag of frozen food. No flavor at all

My friend insisted we eat there a few days ago. I thought maybe she would have got a clue by now. So I ate there and was pleased to see that she was wearing a glove on one hand. Progress. WRONG I was. She was handling the money at the register using both hands and then touching the food with that glove.

I ordered the beef stew noodles and was pretty underwhelmed. Big bowl, but not a lot of egg noodles and the beef cubes were so-so not the most tender. Carrots unevenly cooked. I added bok choy from a side of steamed veggies to add more character. The food in the bowl ran out rather quickly and I just wish there were more noodles. 

Also tried the Chilean sea bass fried rice. I thought the fish itself was bland and unseasoned and the fried rice portion was too al Dente and lacked ""fluff"". 

There was a coho salmon special on the board and it turned out dry but those flavors weren't too bad. 

We had ordered the spring roll appetizer ($9.50) which was larger than normal and great tasting but the meat was a little thin inside and there wasn't any basil accompaniment.

"It's a shame I am giving them a 1-star review. Their food used to be decent (never great, but okay, since there aren't many Thai places in this area). Today I ordered my go-to item which is one of their most popular dishes - yellow curry chicken. What a shame. It tasted so bland and watered down, I couldn't finish it. My husband thought the same. The onions were too crunchy and potatoes were hard - not cooked long enough. We also ordered Pad Thai chicken for the kids, and it was just awful. First of all, it had no vegetables other than bean sprouts and a few pieces of green onions. No shredded carrots or anything like that. The chicken tasted so dry, it was difficult to chew for the kids. I had to just cut it up into small pieces. Overall, the taste was bland and dry, meaning not enough sauce or flavor. Sad to say, but i won't be coming back here.",1,0,0,0,0
"I was super excited to try this place as I've had it bookmarked on my Yelp to try for brunch particularly because they serve the impossible burger.

So, where shall I begin. 

Came here on a Sunday around 1ish and of course it's brunch time so we had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes which actually felt quicker than the time we were quoted. (2 in my party)

When we receive it or server started out strong very energetic and friendly. I started out with avocado toast and he recommended the fresh squeezed orange juice.
Drinks came no problem, and orange juice wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. 

So minutes pass by and two are left two girls were seated after us I'm talking minutes after us and they seem to have gotten to avocado toast before we did. To our righ was another group of patrons who were also seated after us and they got served their entree immediately. 

So at this point my husband is looking at me like what is going on here. I see the manager and I flag her down and she was very apologetic and assured me that our food will be coming out soon. Finally our avocado toast came then shortly after of our entrees came. My husband order their burger and as our server was bringing down the platter to our table he literally dismantled the burger. Then as he was placing my platter in front of me, I drops a few fries on my lap and says, ""oops."" 

I mean, do I really need to go on about the service or lack there of? The food was not good despite the yelp comments maybe the photos were much better than the comments itself. My impossible burger was good I'm talking about the patty because it was plant-based and tasted nothing like it. It had no dressing my burger had no onions on it and my husband said that his burger patty was burnt and raw in the middle so he didn't even finish the whole thing. 

Seriously quite dissatisfied and disappointed and we will not be back. Also just a note we were charged twice on our check for one of the burgers so do yourself a favor and always review your check. 

Sorry, but despite the near perfect reviews this one missed their mark on impressing me with a good bite.",2,2,1,1,0

That said.... even if the food was spectacular (and it was just OK-- nothing spectacular), I won't be returning. The server (who I guess after reading other reviews, is actually the owner) was incredibly rude. I ordered a simple soup, added the side of vegetables off the menu, and asked for no noodles. I got a dirty look, a sigh, an eye roll, and he said, ""No, that is too complicated. We can't do that."" My face must have been hilarious, because I looked at him like, ""Seriously? Am I being punked?"" This was not a needy request. I'm on an almost no carb diet. I have asked for no noodles in my pho at dozens and dozens of pho places over the years. I've worked in restaurants a long time..... this is not even close to a hard request, and to get that response with the worst attitude was just so off putting. They brought the soup out and I almost left before it even came out because I felt that upset.

"Nope. I am definitely not a fan.
My guy and I came here on a Friday night in hopes of a delicious, hearty meal and Big T's did not deliver.

Upon arrival, parking was a breeze. There were plenty of open spots to choose from which isn't always the case since the lot is kind of limited for this little strip of businesses. 
We walked into a bare restaurant with one party sitting outside and two other tables being occupied inside. 

Maggie was our server- she was friendly and patient right from the very start. She offered to take our drink orders and answered whatever questions we had. 

Our food consisted of: 
-[steamed] Seafood Combo Platter with Big T's Garlic Butter Sauce. 
-[steamed] Sea Snails in San Jose Sauce 
-bowl of Clam Chowder

Clam chowder arrived first and it was okaaaaay. Not the best but definitely not the worst. I liked the chunky bits of celery and there was a decent amount of clams.
Seafood Combo platter looked good but the lacking in freshness left us dumbfounded. The garlic butter sauce was doable but very watered down which added to the disappointment- we requested for our dishes steamed because we were told that boiling it would cause for a lot of liquid which we wanted to avoid. 
Sea Snails were good in quality and big in size. The negative aspect comes downs to the SJ sauce which was guaranteed to be spicy. This sauce was also very watered down and the spice level was muted by WATER. 

2 stars because our server was very nice and welcoming. I can't see myself coming back for any other reason. Expensive food that doesn't taste good- Thanks but no thanks.",2,13,22,16,0

"Brand new place for Korean food lovers in San Ramon. Their outside sign showed ""Korean soul food "" and yes their choice of menus are simple yet have many Korean people's favorites. I am giving 2 stars because they have more room to improve!

We ordered Jjajang Myun, Jjam Pong, Dduk bokki and Tangsu mandu for three of us. 
Their noodles for Jjajang and JjamPong were a little disappointing but the sauces were pretty good. DdukBokki I wouldn't order it again since it was way too sweet for my taste. 
They used store bought mandu for their tangsu mandu and it wasn't our favorite at all. But their tangsu sauce was good. 

My suggestion for them is that they need to improve presentation of food and quantity. When I received food on the table I didn't feel I was getting our money's worth. Portions were lacking and the presentation wasn't great. 

Overall, I would give them another try after their soft open in about month or two. I will update my review then.

"I had high expectations of this place because if it's rating. I ordered the orange chicken as a lunch special. My friend ordered the beef, but a full size and not a lunch special. I wanted to order the lettuce cups, the waitress told me they were very busy and couldnt make it because it was too hard for them. Very unprofessional. Lettuce cups...too difficult....??

The food arrived and I had gotten the wrong dish. I told them nicely that I had said orange chicken and she told me that I had said beef. She corrected me. I felt like I needed to apologize for the misunderstanding although I did not do anything to cause it. My friends food came out and it was not the full size, they brought him a lunch special. Which was not the right size. They brought him out a second serving of the lunch size to compensate but charged us for a second lunch special. Now we we're being overcharged. 

The quality of the food was just about god awful. The orange chicken was greasy and fried with some kind of simple batter that I didn't enjoy and it hardly tasted like orange. I tried my friends beef and it was..to say the least...bad. everything was squishy

"The spicy miso is very watery and bland (and not at all spicy). The presliced meat is not the best quality, I've seen way better cuts elsewhere. They also have the plates out, unrefrigerated (!!), in the back so they can give them to you quicker, which seems like a health hazard.

The vegetables are not great and super basic (white button mushrooms?). I don't care for the glass noodles. The premixed sauce blend is very sour / not good and they don't have plain ponzu (??).

The service is attentive and kind.

The bathroom is mehhhhhhh / dirty.

It's run by a Viet/Canto family and I think this place is a favorite amongst the locals because there's nothing else around this place. Really just not for us and way too far for us to come back.

The amount of short rib was very little and scissors they give you was super dull. Basically used it like tongs to rip. Only half the grill worked. One side was too high and the other side didn't have enough heat. Best dish was pork belly. The rest of the dishes were meh.

"It has been over a month since we tried this place out. I wanted to write a review after our meal, but I was going to give the restaurant another try before doing so. We decided the food was too bad on our first visit to give it another try it.

My partner said, ""The best thing about this restaurant is the conversation."" The owner was really pleasant to him when he ordered our takeout dinners and they held a quite lengthy conversation. This is the reason for a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star rating.

Overall the food was inedible because it was so salty. My son and I who shared a plate could not eat the food. I was able to eat part of the pork chop because it was smothered in a salty gravy, but the salt was diluted because I ate it with the unseasoned meat and unseasoned rice. I was only able to eat part of a pork chop because even though the gravy was diluted by the unseasoned items, it still became too salty for me to eat. I know my blood pressure was rising while I was eating the pork chop. 

My two-year-old son who LOVES macaroni and cheese, spit the macaroni and cheese back onto the plate. I did not eat the macaroni and cheese or the collard greens because they were too salty. My dog, who will eat ANYTHING, did not eat the rest of my meal.

I wanted to like this restaurant because it is local soul food and Black owned.

"I am beyond disappointed in the ""updated"" Grove! This used to be one of my favorite brunch spots with great food and a fun atmosphere now it was nothing but a huge disappointment and overall mess.

First off, the line to order food was long, and slow moving, the menu is written above the pizza oven but it isn't clear that you can only order a limited section (at least on Sundays) so I noticed a lot of people having to change their minds at the front, holding up the line.

My favorite used to be the huevos rancheros, which is no longer an option, and my husband used to love the chicken and waffles which is nothing like it used to be! I ended up ordering the pulled pork scramble which was barely even warm. It looked like it was made last week and put in the microwave for 20 seconds! I've had better food on the airlines... 

I waited in line with only one person in front of me to get a simple cup of black coffee. The lady in front of me ordered 1 Frappuccino and that took about 15 minutes for them to make. In the meantime my microwaved breakfast came up so I gave up on the coffee.

"My son and I recently came here to eat while passing the time away to get a seat done. My first impression was how cool the place looked and also, how convenient it was to have a place to grab a bite and a cup of coffee while waiting. 

We came in and no one offered to seat us or even acknowledge us so we grabbed a seat and sat down. The waitress came and took our order. I ordered chorizo and eggs and my son got a breakfast that came with pancakes. Even though there was only one other person eating in there, our food took forever. Mine came out first and we didnt have any silverware, I asked the waitress and she said she would get it. I opened the tortillas and I swear these were the worse tortillas I have ever ever seen in my life, there were dry and hard as a rock. Damn near close to taco shell. I asked the waitress if she could send them back and she came back with new ones that were just as hard. Almost like they were under a heat lamp for 24 hours. I also asked for silverware again. 15 minutes later, my son got his breakfast and I asked AGAIN for silverware!!! His pancakes were raw inside. 

To top this all off, I think we got about 2 words from the waitress, until she brought the check and we got a half ass smile and thank you.

"Came here for DimSum. Parents came to visit and since I have been here so many times and I enjoyed every time, I figure to bring them here. 

Noticed the food served on the cart with the plastic windows are not hot. The bottom of the cart is supposed to be outfitted with burners. There are holes on the bottom shelf that are see-thru to the floor. Not even warm. The mango pudding supposed to be chilled is sitting along side with the fried tofu which is supposed to be hot. The pan fried chive dumplings and fried shrimp balls are cool to the touch. The fried taro was cool too. 
The person pushing the cart says it just came out. That might be true but it definitely was not just fried. So make sure it's hot. It will taste way better. 

The steam cart is always hot. 
As well as the soup cart. 

We ordered a fried crispy pork hoc. The skin was between crispy/chewy. And for a special order $18.80 supposed to be very hot. This pork hoc was room temperature. 

The fried chive dumpling barely had any chives in it. There was several chunks of pork, big chunks the size of a standard dice. 

Everything today was big with lots of substitute filling and the dumpling wrapper is too thick.

"A review from a LONGTIME customer:

I remember when MUA first opened- it was only the downstairs. I remember when the owner of MUA would
park his car next door at the Audi dealership and would eat with the customers. I remember when MUA used to project old school movies on their projector on the left hand wall. I remember when I had my first Bismarck and called it my favorite drink and i would look forward to drinking it at my then- so called ""favorite restaurant"" in my hometown of Oakland. I am saddened to say that this place no longer holds that title. 

I was there last Friday with my three girlfriends. We were waiting for another group of people to join us as we were enjoying our Friday night. We waited at the bar where my first encounter occurred. I ordered a glass of tequila and was happily enjoying it when one of the waitresses ""accidentally"" refilled it with water. I kindly told her that there was still tequila in there and she rudely replied with ""no there wasn't you'll have to talk to the bartender about that"" and walked away. 

As a customer i felt disrespected and her tone was very un called for. One of the bartenders was nice enough to take care of it quickly. After seeing a friend of mine at the bar he ordered me food. I told him i was with another party and was going to bring my food back to my table. My friend payed for our drinks at the bar and left (leaving a nice tip). 

I brought my food to my table and ate. The rest of our party joined us at the table. 

THIS IS WHEN MUAS TITLE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT WAS TAKEN AWAY..

I sat back down at my table and my other friend got up and ended up talking to the owner/hostess. She came back with the news that we were no longer welcomed at MUA. 

The reasons: we broke the rule of ordering food at the bar and bringing it to our table (where are the rules written at again?), we never tip (excuse me?) we always increase our party size (I'm sorry- you would think a restaurant would be able to accommodate these kind of things especially if I'm a long time customer and always bring you customers) the owner went on to say that the type of people we bring made the restaurant staff uncomfortable and that they never like to serve us (racist much? We are all minorities). 

I've been a customer at MUA for over 10 years. I've brought my family members here, guests from out of town, and other new comers to the bay looking for a good meal. After the horrible hospitality and disrespect that we experienced on 11/1/2019 we will never return here.

"This is a REAL review. Not playing along with owners request to give him bad yelp reviews. The whole reason he is doing that is because he got legitimate bad reviews and couldn't take it!

The food here is way overpriced. Nearly $40 for a large pizza and let's say you like some fresh extra mozzarella added to your pizza; it's $9. more for that. Yes, this is correct folks!

All the food here is overpriced and the portions small, see my picture. I get a distinct impression that the owner actually doesn't want to offer any food, and would rather have no customers and just hang out, but will grudgingly cook something if he is able to price gauge for it.",2,20,11,2,0
"I came to Khan hoping to get the best of both worlds (AYCE Shabu and KBBQ) but ended up getting a mediocre and sad attempt to do both. Khan really missed the mark with their attempt at creating an AYCE buffet style restaurant that serves both Shabu and Korean bbq. 

Food
-Quality is not there. The meats did not taste fresh and appear to be frozen. The prepared foods were all cold and stale from sitting out. Things are not clearly labeled so you have to guess what meat you're eating. Also, the goma sauce taste like mayo mixed with peanuts.. horrendous. Shabu broth is like sink water. 

Service
-one saving grace was good service. Our waiter should be a car salesman as he was so good at making everything sound delicious. He even said the broth was created not flavorful on purpose to accompany the meat juice. God bless this man. 

Environment
-the place looks pretty run down. Grills are all losing their coating and the chairs are ratchet. Not a good look and not what I'd expect from an AYCE establishment. 

Overall, not impressed by Khan. They did not impress me with any of their food to be honest. Will not be back.",2,3,7,3,0
"First time trying out their noodles and probably my last time. 

I ordered the Stewed Beef Brisket (with rice noodles) for $10.99. The portion size was decent since they give you plenty of noodles for even a small. The noodles themselves feel similar to pho rice noodles, but a little wider with a mushier texture that's really off-putting. The soup was also on the spicy side (which were expected) and oily as heck - I found myself wiping my lips with napkins after every slurp. Another disappointment was the beef - tough and chewy, so thank God they gave me very little. The only mild satisfaction was the chili condiment on tables... So deliciously HOT! 

The service was below average and absolutely non responsive. Dirty tables, our waiter never once checked in on us, but at least food arrived quickly. In all, it was entirely an underwhelming experience! And with the plethora of choices for great Chinese noodle places in the area, I don't think I will make my way back here again.",2,37,70,57,0
"Pretty generic bland Mexican food cash only I've never understood cash only businesses they're losing on so much potential I would have spent more but all I had was $25 cash and I don't think this place should show up on cheap eats 10.50 for nachos 4.50 for a taco 7.70 for a burrito 1.50 for chips and salsa 1.80 per can of soda.

 The employees have been shooting the shit in Spanish cursing since we arrived they assume people don't understood but guess what I do. I feel really jipped from this place I was expecting Chinese Mexican food but the only thing chino was nothing. I remember eating some bom ass Chinese Mexican food in Mexico City D.F. Zona Rosa guess I had my hope up way too much. 

 The food here was ok nothing memorable just bland af i guess maybe they need to cater to the gringos around here.",2,1,1,1,0
"Pro: Japchae (Stir fried vermicelli with vegetables and beef; Dolsot-bibimbap (Chopped and sauteed shrimp, squid, octopus, in hot stone pot with rice and egg,

Con: Ox-tail soup (no flavor soup/broth, tasted like hot water only, huge mistake in ordering this item). Arrived at restaurant around 5:20 and waited 50 minutes before getting a table. Restaurant was serving two bus loads of Korean tourists which resulted in tables not being available. When we requested additional ban-chan (side dishes), waitress did not complied or returned. Perhaps they were overwhelmed serving the Korean tourists?

Conclusion: Granted it may have been a busy evening, ignoring request to bring additional ban-chan was unforgivable. Except for the ox-tail soup, the other two entrees were good but not spectacular. I have eaten at better Korean restaurants. I am reluctant to return to this place.",2,1,1,1,0
This place is always closed especially during holidays. They also don't have the store hours updated between Google and Yelp. Not to mention they change the hours whenever they feel like there isn't enough customers. So inconsistent!,1,1,3,0,0
"You'd think that all chain restaurants would be essentially the same, however, since being renovated, this location's quality of service, short wait time and food preparation have all declined significantly, which is quite the opposite of what you'd expect.

I don't quite know how it happened, but after placing my order in one of the two drive-thru������� speakers, I was handed a meal that was completely different from what I ordered. Additionally, when I told the fellow working the window that there had been some sort of mistake, he proceeded to argue with me about what I ordered. This resulted in me having to get out of my car and walk into the restaurant to get everything sorted out... a process I was trying to avoid from the beginning. 

Although it took some extra time and was more hassle than I had originally������� bargained for, everything ultimately worked out. I just wish it didn't have to come to that. 

I think I'll pass on coming back ",1,0,2,0,0
"I had the worst dining experience here. It took 20 minutes just to get water and to place an order, and the place was empty. Our server pulled the old disappearing act. Mediocre food that took 2 hours for lunch! I even had to take the bill to the front to pay after waiting 15 minutes with no sign of the server. I was offered a not so humble apology by hostess and sent on my way with the promise that my next visit would be better. Not that I'm a regular, but I've been coming here for 14 years...never again!
Update: Hugo the manager asked for my contact information, which I provided. Guess what I heard back from him? Nada, just crickets. Don't believe him when he posts a response acting like he will make it up to you for paying for a horrible experience.
Update: Still waiting, Hugo!",1,0,1,0,0
"We wandered into Billy's on a Sunday afternoon. There's about 20 or so tables inside and a couple out on the sidewalk. One of the servers saw us waiting and told us that we could sit anywhere. We chose a window seat, and though the place is small, it must have been hidden from notice as we didn't have anyone stop by for at least 10 minutes. The busboy stopped by to offer us water. It was another 10 minutes before a server stopped by. We were just about to get up and leave when she stopped by to take our order: Fish and chips, side of beans, and onion rings. 

The service was pretty consistent throughout. Two servers working 12 to 14 tables total, with a busboy. And yet we hardly ever saw anyone. 

The fish and chips is advertised with two sides, but it turns out the ""chips"" count as one of the sides. The best thing, hands down, were the beans. They have bacon and just a hint of smoke. The fish and onion rings were good but both were still coated in wet grease. The fish was nicely cooked but the whole dish wouldn't be my first choice if we were to return. 

With all the quality places to eat in Los Gatos, I think it'll be a long time before we return.",2,0,4,0,0
"It baffles me that this place is still in business. Paid 17 bucks for dry turkey and chicken in terms of the two plate option. Furthermore, the two workers today were extremely unhelpful and slow.

"Went here once... shame on them. Went here twice, shame on me. Aside from the fact that this place is ghetto AF, the chicken is greasy and nasty. Also, don't get the beans... they taste like metal... you're better off getting a hand full of washers to suck on. Sorry to dump on a place but this is the kind of place where an idiot in front of you in line fucks it up for everyone behind because the people working there give that idiot all their attention. In the end, it's gas station food.",1,1,1,0,0
